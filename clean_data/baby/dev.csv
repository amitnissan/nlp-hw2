0,"With the right tools, this item should be easy to assemble. I am no handy person but I did all by myself even if it took me about 4 hours without the correct tools. Went to Home Depot to get a set of multi-tool screw driver for about $10 and came back to finish the rest in less than half an hour. With all the screws in proper place the dresser is quite solid and nice looking. I gave it a 4 stars because of the cardboard at the bottom drawers. I would recommend it to any one who is on budget and don't mind put in a few hours",True
1,Our young granddaughter sit and plays with this but the best thingies she will be able to use it when she is learning to stand as well.,True
2,"new to cloth diapering- trying to figure out if its right for you?- check out this link to help break down the lingo and facts: [...]. if that link doesnt work- i will copy and paste the info at the bottom of this review. And now- MY two cents....I used disposable first as my baby was too small to fit into his ALL-IN-ONE BumGenius pocket diapers. He grew into them once he reached 10 lbs. (around 1 month old). Originally I only had 20 diapers but quickly purchased another 20. The total of 40 diapers ran around $650.00. If you do the math, thats what you will pay for dispoables in the first 5 - 6 months! I wash them on average twice a week and with each passing month they are circulating more slowly (as my baby's bowels function more regularly and effeceintly). They are holding up very well so far. VERY few leaks. Actally had more leaks and blowouts with the disposable diapers- also more issues with diaper rash. They go on with ease- the velcro makes them just like disposable diapers. Once I have removed the used diaper I simply place it in my Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag. I initially feared there would be smells through my house from this type of diapering. There is NO SMELL. I have asked visitors and no one even knew I was cloth diapering due to a dirty diaper smell. To wash, I use a special detergent on them: Charlie's Soap Powder or Rockin Green Cloth Diaper and Laundry Detergent. Until the baby begins on solids, soiled diapers can go right from the wetbag to the wash- just add a presoak and extra rinse as you follow the washing instructions. Once you are getting solid bowel movements- you can use liners and shke solids off into a toilet. Warning- even if liner says ""flushable"" DO NOT FLUSH- its not worth the plumming bill!These diapers make cloth diapering as easy as disposable with the obvious $$$ benefit. I dont know why people are still using disposable diapers. REALLY, what a waste of money!HERES THE INFO FROM THAT LINK IN THE BEGINNING OF MY REVIEW:Curious About Cloth?Get the Skinny on Today's Cloth DiapersToday's parents make hundreds of decisions for their little ones with a combination of instinct, friends' advice, and research. Even with the recent surge in sales of new types of cloth diapers, many parents remain unaware of the latest developments in cloth. Curious moms are going to the Internet to research, but basic information is still somewhat hard to find.There have always been economic and environmental advantages to using cloth diapers. Clearly, having diapers that can be washed and used again saves (a lot of) money and keeps disposable diapers from filling up landfills. Even the most expensive and fancy cloth diapering system will save the average family $1,000 or more over disposables. Unfortunately, many moms today still envision cloth diapering as squares of cotton, safety pins (eek!) and plastic pants.CuteyBaby wants to help! Here we summarize the general categories of modern cloth diapers and give you the pros and cons of using each type:The ""Wrap with Prefolds"" diaper:Bummis Whisper WrapThe closest thing to traditional cloth diapering of all the modern diapers. The Wrap (also called a ""Cover"") is waterproof, typically PUL (Polyester Urethane Laminate) fabric with elastic edges. Some Wraps put the PUL between layers of cotton for a very soft feel. The Wrap usually closes with Velcro or snaps so you can adjust fit. Absorbent layers - which could be cotton, hemp, bamboo, or microfiber - are placed inside the wrap to hold liquid. Some moms attach the absorbent layers with a Snappi closure. A ""prefold"" just refers to the old kind of diaper with thickness down the center.Hemp Babies FlatsSeveral manufacturers make squares (""Prefolds"" or ""Flats"") that you fold in thirds to use inside a Wrap. Prefolds and Flats can be a variety of materials. Cotton and hemp are popular. At changing time, some moms will just switch the absorbent layers and re-use the Wrap/Cover if the baby is only a little wet.Pros: Cheap - the least expensive of cloth diaper styles. Flexible - Moms can adjust absorbency by adding more layers.Cons: Putting them together requires extra time, effort.Examples: Wraps: Bummis, Thirsties, Imse VimsePrefolds/Flats: Swaddlebees, Bummis, Green Acre Designs, Hemp BabiesThe ""Wrap with Fitted"" diaper:Kissaluvs Fitted Cloth DiaperThis diapering method is similar to the ""Wrap with Prefolds"" approach except it has a fitted absorbent layer. Several manufacturers make fitted diapers in cotton, bamboo, and other natural fiber blends. The absorbent fitted diaper may have Velcro or snaps to close, and the wrap goes over it to form a moisture barrier.Pros: Better absorbency and comfort than ""Wrap with Prefolds"".Cons: Sort of like putting 2 diapers on, need to buy more sizes, longer drying times than flats.Examples: Fitteds: Kissaluvs, Swaddlebees, Baby Beehinds, ThirstiesWraps: see aboveThe ""Pocket"" Diaper:Bum Genius Pocket DiaperPocket diapers are made with an outer PUL waterproof layer, inside wicking layer, and ""stuffed"" with washable absorbent pads (called soakers, doublers, boosters) from an opening in (usually the back edge of) the diaper. It is the most common design because it can be loaded up with absorbent layers that stay relatively in place. There is typically a soft interior material, which gives the baby healthier skin and a dryer feel. Pocket diapers are often ""one-size"" designs that can be adjusted to fit babies of different sizes.Pros: Selection - Many options with snaps, Velcro, different soakers. Adjustability - fits a wide variety of infants. Absorbency can be adjusted by stuffing in extra soakers.Cons: Requires disassembly before and re-stuffing after washing. Some fleece insides may stain. One-size designs can be bulky at the small settings and may not fit up to potty training age.Examples: Happy Heiny, Fuzzi Bunz, Bum Genius, Smartipants, Blueberry, Rocky MountainThe ""All-In-One/All-In-Two"" diaper (AIO or AI2):CuteyBaby All-in-One Cloth DiaperThese diapers are usually all one piece but sometimes have a snap in soaker, making it an ""all-in-two"". The easiest type to use, they require little or no assembly and, like all cloth diapers, can be washed in a regular home washing machine. Outer layer is waterproof and typically PUL polyester or nylon fabric and the inside usually includes a multi-layer microfiber (also called microterry) or cotton soaker for absorbency. Some AIO/AI2 diapers come in sizes, and other are adjustable ""one-size"" designs.Pros: Simple - Very easy to use, no stuffing/assembly needed.Cons: Often require longer drying times, may not have enough built-in absorbency.Examples: Dream-Eze, GroBaby, CuteyBabyDiaper DialogueGetting started with cloth diapers can be confusing! Different manufacturers may call something by different names. To help you sort things out, here are a few of the most common terms:Soaker: The soaker is the highly absorbent portion of the diaper. A soaker may be a completely separate piece that is either laid or snapped into the diaper, or it can be partially or fully attached. Soakers usually have multiple layers stitched together to form a long pad shape (can be rectangular or contoured). Also see: DoublerDoubler: A doubler looks like a pad and is an absorbent soaker that can be added to a cloth diaper if you are having leakage problems or for times when extra protection may be needed such as overnight. It ""doubles"" the absorbency of the original soaker, hence the name.Booster: Like a doubler (above), but lighter-duty. Boosters ""boost"" the absorbency of a soaker, hence the name.Liner: This is a super-thin (paper-like) layer that some moms like to put on top, inside their cloth diapers. Liners are disposable or flushable and usually come on a roll. Liquids flow through to the diaper as usual, but liners keep the poop from staining or sticking - you can flush or throw them away at each diaper change.Snappi: A special ""T"" or ""Y"" shaped plastic closure to secure fitteds or contours (like a fitted with no elastic or closure) on the baby (replaces diaper pins). Snappis are not needed for Pocket or All-in-One/Two diaper styles.One-size vs. Sized/Fitted: Some diapers have adjustability built-in, others come in sizes. Usually you sacrifice some comfort at the high and low end of the size range for ""One-size"" diapers. Sized diapers will give the best fit, but you will need to buy more as your baby grows. Check out our Cloth Diaper Comparison chart to see how a size ""medium"" fitted diaper compares to ""one-size"" diapers in a few of the top diaper lines.Wet Bag: Many moms like to have these washable, waterproof fabric zipper bags for dirty diapers. You can also just stash some plastic grocery bags in your diaper bag to bring home dirties. Wet Bags come in a variety of sizes and large ones are nice to have near your changing area to hold the day's diaper laundry.Fabrics:PUL: Polyester Urethane Laminate (PUL) is used as a waterproof outer (or layer) fabric for many Wraps, Pocket, and All-in-One/Two diapers. 100% Polyester interlock is laminated (could be 1-2 mil thickness) on one side and becomes waterproof but remains breathable. Good quality PUL can withstand very high temperatures and should last for 100s of washings. Note: we have heard both P.U.L. and ""pull"" as pronociations.Microfiber/Microterry: Microterry fiber is a low-lint, soft fiber that is ideal for use as a cloth diaper soaker, doubler or booster. It is the most common fabric used for Pocket diaper soakers. Good quality microfiber has a velvety feel and typically contains 80% polyester and 20% polyamide fibers. Microfiber is 3-4 times as absorbent as cotton for the same bulk and will dry faster.Suedecloth: Used as a lining in many pocket and All-in-One/Two diapers, suedecloth is typically 100% polyester woven material that has a soft feel. It resists staining and wicks away moisture to the inside of the diaper. The fabric will not hold moisture making cleanup a breeze and keeping baby's skin drier than cotton.Microfleece / Microchamois: Thin, soft fleece is used as a lining in some pocket diapers. This is usually 100% polyester or sometimes recycled plastic fiber content. Microfleece and microchamois (pronounced micro-shammy) have a soft feel against the skin and pull moisture in to the soaking layers. They do stain more easily than other lining fabrics.Cotton: Our old friend cotton still plays a big role in diapering. Organic cotton is a popular soaker/inside material and is used for fitted and contour diapers (that require a cover). Cotton is very slow to dry and may require up to 8 washes before it reaches full absorbency. Organic cotton is grown without chemical pesticides, which costs more, but is kinder to the environment. However, organic and ""regular"" cotton perform the same in diapering.Hemp (fleece, terry): Hemp is stronger, more absorbent, and more durable than cotton and most other fabrics. Hemp on its own is not soft enough for baby's skin, so most hemp fabrics are 55% hemp with 45% cotton. Hemp also carries natural antibacterial properties. Hemp requires several hot washes to reach full absorbency (called prepping), and it will shrink A LOT - usually in one direction. Hemp absorbs like crazy and many moms swear by hemp Doublers/Boosters (see above) for night time cloth diapering.Bamboo (fleece, velour): Bamboo has a silky texture and is very absorbent. It is a naturally antibacterial fiber that will not lose its softness after countless washes. Bamboo fleece and velour are used in fitted diapers and as interior diaper fabrics. Along with hemp, bamboo is kind to the environment due to it being easily renewable and bug-resistant. Bamboo and hemp are still quite expensive fabrics, and that will show in the price of diapers that use them.Wool: Many experienced cloth diapering moms swear by wool outer layers. Wool requires some special care to keep its water resistance, and I wouldn't recommend it for a mom who is trying out cloth diapering for the first time. However, if you are really dedicated to using natural fibers, this is the only one with built-in moisture resisting qualities.What do you do with the poop?Modern diapers do NOT get soaked in an icky pail of wet stuff! Thank goodness!! Most cloth diapers will have the instruction: ""shake off solids"" and then wash in hot water with 1/3 the normal amount of liquid detergent. If you are new to cloth diapering, I recommend getting some disposable/flushable liners with your first purchase. If you line the diapers, then you just lift off the little liner thing and trash or flush it. If no liner, then you sort of shake poops out into the toilet. Some moms like to have their dirty diaper bin in the bathroom. So at changing time they take off the dirty dipe, set it aside, put on fresh diaper - then walk into the bathroom & shake out / flush, leaving the dirties in a container or laundry bag in the bathroom. Other moms (myself included) have two bins by the changing table - one for trash (shake out or put liner in there) and one for the diaper laundry. You can wash every 1-3 days, depending on preference, and how many diapers you have.Want to try it out?Lots of cloth diapering moms (myself included) started out just wanting to cut down on trash & expenses and were willing to ""test drive"" cloth for part-time use. If you want to try cloth diapering, pick the type of diaper that suits you best and buy enough for one day's use (usually 6-10 diapers or 4-6 wraps plus prefold/fitted). Maybe pick two brands and buy a few of each so you can see what you like best. Once you see that it's ""no big deal"" you can expand your collection - or ""stash"" of diapers, as we say. If you don't like it, there are several sites where people buy pre-owned diapers in good condition. Simply take a quick photo, post your items for sale on Diaper Swappers or eBay, and make your graceful exit from cloth.Note: If you have a cloth diaper retailer near you, DO go to a specialty shop. The people there can be extremely helpful and will answer any questions you have about the different types of cloth diapers.",True
3,I love huggies diapers. I tried a few cheaper brands and these are the best for my kids. I love how thin they are and they don't get too huge when wet.I do wish they didn't have any prints on the diaper though. The ink transfers onto my kids onesies and they are now blue and green by the snaps. If this didn't happen they would be 5 stars!! I wish they would come out with plain white diapers.,True
4,"We bought this for my 4-month-old son. It took him a couple days to learn how to spin around in the seat, but now he loves it. He bounces and plays with all of the toys. He usually plays so well that he falls asleep in there without any fussing at all.This jumperoo is easy to set up. The only trouble I had at all was adjusting the height of the seat. When you move the straps into the level 3 position it can be a little difficult, but I was able to get it after a while.Great toy! Highly recommended.",True
5,"We had purchased a sleep sheep a year or two ago for my son as he preferred white noise to music - we since lost the noise box and had another baby so we bought another one and they have only improved the product! Snuggly, adorable and soft the stuffed sheep is terrific and the noise box is great. You can have it continually play or have 2 timer options. I love the whale noises, and the rain is very nice too. Much easier on the ears than some other noises. Highly recommend!",True
6,Love it!!! Super useful and looks a lot better than the blasted duck ones that are everywhere. It matches our Boon Frog and Potty bench great!!!,True
7,"I bought several of these with various patterns, a move I regret. I should have bought several of the same design, because my kids love them so much that they fight over which one they're going to eat with. I had actually expected it to be a little thicker and padded, but they are flat and thin, about the thickness of a CD but flexible- they can be rolled up. They hold up well to spills, although chewing on it does cause some wear and tear.",True
8,"I bought this step stool because of all the good reviews. They were right! I love this step stool for my 3 year old son. He loves to wash his hands now at the bathroom sink. He has also started Brushing his poor neglected teeth because he can stand on the stool like a big boy and see himself in the mirror! I think we must have an odd shaped toilet, because I can't imagine how he can stand on a stool and tinkle in the toilet... he has tried a couple times, but the bowl is just too far forward.. So he sits on the potty chair.. Not the stools fault i am sure because it does kinda tuck under the bowl... I love this stool and would recommend it to anybody who needed a stool for their little one. Totally non skid!!!",True
9,AWESOME; DAUGHTER RECOMMENDED PURCHASE AND TODDLER AND NEW BABY LOVE TO PLAY WITH IT! VERY ENTERTAINING; DO NOT GET BORED EASILY NOR FEEL CLOSED IN!,True
10,This is a great gift and I recommend it highly for 5 to 10 month olds. I bought it for both of my grandsons and it was one of the favorites. They both loved to sit and bounce in it when they were about five months until they started walking.,True
11,I bought this potty for my kids over 20 years ago and bought it again for my grandson.I must agree the plastic is not as heavy duty as it was 20 years ago but it works just as great.It is easy for the child to place on the toilet by themselves. Encourages independence. The handles are well placed for them to turn around. The step is adjustable to give your little boy the opportunity to stand and go.I think this product is fantastic.,True
12,I have tried most bottles that are sold in stores. This bottle has a lid that actually keeps the bottle from leaking. It costs a little more than other bottles but the price is worth it. No more digging in the diaper bag and there is spilt milk.,True
13,"This Baby Bjorn product, as is the case with every one of their products, is of the utmost quality. I have never used or bought a Baby Bjorn product that didn't live up to its reputation. This toilet trainer is particularly exceptional because it is easy to install and use. It also scores high marks for the fact that it requires little or no cleaning after each use. Once you have set it up, you will not need to fiddle with it. Your kids will enjoy using the &quot;big seat&quot; just like an adult, and they will also enjoy the fact that they will be able to do it all by themselves! Skip the traditional self-contained potties and get this one...you will not regret it.",True
14,"Arrived in perfect condition. Absolutely charming mobile. I didn't realize the trains required assembly when I ordered this. Upon seeing the cut pieces to assemble, I was intimidated. However, it was easy! The pieces just click together. It was actually pretty fun putting them together. This is a very lightweight mobile; the trains move and float around at the slightest movement of air. Soothing to watch and really cute.",True
15,"We bought this when my girls were able to sit up on their own very well, probably around 7-8 months. I had been using a newborn to toddler tub in the kitchen sink which was great but I could only give 1 a bath at a time(leaving 1 of them always unhappy sitting in their high chair) plus they discovered what splashing was and my hardwood floor didn't like that.The perfect solution was this inflatable duck tub. The first time I put this in our tub, filled it up & added daughters, they had a blast! They were laughing and squealing and splashing all over.The sides are a great height for them to hold onto and keep themselves balanced and they are durable as well...even when both my girls lean on the same side it doesn't smoosh down.This has really made bath time easier and more enjoyable for me and especially more enjoyable for them.It only takes me about a minute to blow this up. I don't think the temperature dot works well, I think my girls would freeze if I payed attention to the dot but I always rely on myself to test the water, not any type of gadget anyhow.",True
16,I have read a lot of reviews on here and apparently you are down grading a product over stupid things such as the wheels roll too fast on hardwood. Common since tells you well duh it is a hard wood floor the wheels are going to go faster. Note: it is made for a child 6-36 months. Why? Most babies walk at 10-13 months. The front detaches so your child can play. Not meant for a child to pull up on duh. So I find it a great toy. I am a mother of 4 and this is one of the best I have seen on the market.,True
17,"Its pretty big & easy to clean. We put this under our kids little table & chair set. They spilled red juice all over it & it caught it all, didn't leak through to the carpet or anything.",True
18,"I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one!First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs.I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up.If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech!",True
19,"Great product and i now have peace of mind when the kids take a bath!! My son who is 4 1/2 recently was playing in the tub and hit his forehead with the faucet. thankfully no stitches were needed but he had a nice cut which bled alot. I immediately started searching the net for a product that covers the faucets and this is the only one i found. Its a great price and it serves it purpose. I also have a 1yr old son too and now i've learned my lesson with tubs, this item is a BIG MUST HAVE!!!!",True
20,"The included sling was perfect when my baby was newborn, the inclined side was great from 2 to 5 months and now that he's 5 months and sits up with support, the seat side works great, too.Lots of room for my 27"" inch long baby to kick and splash (I just started putting the tub on the kitchen floor with a towel underneath and let him splash as much as he wants). It fit great in our single sink when he was smaller, too.The insides and edges are smooth, and the ""spongy"" pads inside help with slippage; I keep my hands on the baby at all times, but when you're rinsing a wiggly baby's hair, holding on to him one-handed, you'll appreciate this feature.I only wish the ""fresh water"" basin was bigger or that there were 2, one at each end.",True
21,"We bought this a couple months ago for our third baby and we can't say enough good things about it. It's comfy, it's warm and it's safe. So far no problems with mildew but it's easy to wash if necessary. This product is waaaaaaay better than using a baby tub. There isn't the usual slipping and sliding of the baby that comes with a tub. You also can have both hands free to wash your baby rather than using one to hold your baby in place while you wash with the other.Buy this, you'll love it!",True
22,"I am not sure what the other reviewer is complaining about. I bought this bassinet and my daughter slept in it until she was 6 months old. She slept fine in it, in fact she slept through out the night by the time she was 6 weeks old. I never had any problems and I loved the night light, it helped me to see her if she woke at night without disturbing my husband. I also liked the different highth positions you could use for bedside or changing table and the rocking or locking into place rolling wheels. You could take the baby in different rooms with the top basket which was nice. The pad that goes on top is about an 1 1/2"" thick and the other reviewer doesn't show that. With the pad and slight weight placed in the bassinet it evens out the slight variations. Have you ever looked at or used a pack-n-play portable play pen. The mattress pad that wraps around the whole unit has several segments and they are all not perfectly even. I don't think that First Years would sell something that wasn't going to be a good product, they have been around for along time. I would recommend this bassinet to anyone, it has so many different uses. I would have kept my baby in it if she had not out grown it. My daughter is a healthy 8 month old and we miss the bassinet.",True
23,We almost bought the Diaper Genie but heard bad things about it. When we read all the good reviews of this product we thought we'd try it. We bought 2 (we have 3 babies) and we love them. No smell and easy to use. Good buy for the money too.,True
24,"I pump exclusively (baby won't latch on), and this pump has been great. I can usually get about 5 ounces out of each breast - 10 minutes each. I like that this is a single breast pump and not a double since getting the hang of a double breast pump can be challenging to say the least! As far as the pump being noisy, if you put the cover over pump (make it look like a purse), it muffles quite a bit of the sound.I, also, wish that this pump didn't accomodate the wide mouth bottles, but considering the sizable savings compared to similar breast pumps, it's not such a big deal. I can definately live with it.I will definately recommend this pump to anyone who asks!",True
25,"We live in a small town and have a very limited assortment of high chairs. At Walmart there were two, and we chose the more expensive Graco. We have a Graco stroller and love it, so I wsas fairly comfortable with our decision. Now I am wondering if plastic is the best choice. We, too, had trouble assembling it (things get stuck), and when I tried to adjust the seat back I found it nearly impossible to push and lift the handle. One day I decided to change it from a reclined position to upright since my daughter can sit well assisted, and the handle got stuck. Now the chairback will slide from one position to the next without locking, so she ends up nearly lyihng on her back. I'm pretty disappointed, and annoyed that we have to now drive three hours away to find a better chair. Boo.",False

30,"This wasn't what I thought it would be. I bought it because it would go from infant to toddler years, thinking I would get the most use out of this seat. However, it wasn't very functionable for our son as a new born. It was almost too big when it was in a stationary position and it was a pain to move from room to room. For our next new born I am buying a different one that is more comforting and soothing. The vibrations on this seat are too much for a little baby and it doesn't play music. The only really good thing I have to say is that now our son is 15 months he loves using this chair as a rocking chair. So it does make a great toddler seat, but not a great infant seat.",False

I called the Pampers costumer service and they offered me a $5 coupom...........yes, I could not believe it, at last they offered a $10 coupom, so I'll still need to spend monwy on it?

35,"We were not very happy with this car seat. We have twins now almost 2 years. We started them in this car seat around 6 months. There is virtually no support for their necks and the girls often wake up crying because their necks hurt from sleeping slumped over. At around 14 months on a road trip, we literally had to give one of our girls medicine and massage her neck because she was crying and could not walk because of the crick in her neck. No matter how we rearranged the cushions or tried to prop them, it continues to be a problem to this day.I also found the adjustment mechanism for the belts to be very difficult to execute until just recently. Don't know if it loosens over time or if it just took me that long to get the hang of it. Cup holders were broken when we first got the units. Very difficult to get seat covers off if you need to wash them. Have to take seats completely out of the car and use a screwdriver.We just bought the Britax Marathon to replace these and I could not be happier. The edges of the unit prop their heads slightly when they sleep avoiding the slumped over pheonomena without creating a barrier that is annoying to them when they are awake. Unlike the Triumph which curves inward and promotes slouching, the Britax is curved outward and has good lumbar support. Adjustments to the belt are a breeze and there is a comfort pad where the attachments all come together. Though the seat looks huge, it does not take up any more space in the car width wise, if anything I think it is thinner and we can use until 65lbs.Wish we had just spent the extra money in the first place.",False
36,"I bought this item because it had good reviews, and looked really cool. It's a turtle with 3 different colored LED lights on the inside that are supposed to project stars in a room or on a ceiling.Of the 3 colors - green, amber and blue - only the green and blue are noticable in pitch black. The amber is almost a waisted option because you can't see it.My problem with this item is it only works in pitch black, and barely in that case. The product shots show it sitting on a nursery floor shining up at the ceiling, this is sooooo impossible. The turtle needs to be at least 2 feet from the ceiling in order to see any of the stars.A total disappointment. I returned it.",False
37,"I have used this bag a few times and it works well in some ways. My Britax Roundabout fits spaciously (as long as it is positioned backwards), and the wheels on the bottom are genius. One major flaw is that the clips that attach the backpack straps to the bag are positioned so they dig into your shoulders when you wear the seat on your back. It is extremely painful, so I have not been able to continue using it as a backpack. I'm now looking for some terry cloth arm bands people wear on their wrists for tennis, and I'm going to try to use those to cover the clips. If I could, I would return this bag for something more comfortable. In the meantime, we attach it to a rolling suitcase and pull it on its wheels, which works sufficiently well, although it is a bit awkward and tippy. I have not (yet) had the fabric tearing problem that the majority of other reviewers complain about. Maybe I just got lucky with gentle airline handlers.",False
38,"We've started using this for our newborn son, and there is no doubt that the device works well in terms of core functionality. However, its commonsense design is poor, and on that basis, I've downgraded it from 5 stars down to 2, as some of these design flaws hit you between the eyes at 2am in the morning, where you really dont have the patience to deal with them.Here are the flaws in its design as I see it, all of them could have been easily fixed if a little more thought had gone into it.1. Volume of movement alarm is linked to the volume of the microphone. The alarm if movement doesn't happen should be as loud as possible, as I want to cover the distance between waking and fixing the problem as soon as possible - however this device has linked the volume of the alarm to be the same as the volume of the baby monitor part. The end result is that if you don't want to get blasted in the ear by your baby's every grunt at night, then you may miss the important movement alarm. Same goes for if your trying to enjoy a quiet (and rare) moment alone with your partner - you might be interested in seeing only the lights to indicate baby's noise level... but this means that the SIDS alarm cannot be heard. Needs at least two volume controls - one for the microphone and another for the alarm (or default the alarm to maximum).2. If you're using the Tic function, with the microphone level turned down, then you can't tell whether the lights flashing is due to movement or sound.3. You need to switch off both ends of the device to deactivate it. Why? If you switch off only the base unit, the parent unit will lose its channel and a stream of static will issue from the parent unit, which will wake your partner. If you don't switch off the base unit, then as soon as you take bub from the cot, 15 seconds later the alarm will sound. At 2 am in the morning, I'm not lucid enough to remember to switch off both ends of the device. The best solution is to switch it from the ""movement and sound"" setting (called ""Tic off"") to the ""sound only"" setting... at least your partner won't get blasted by the alarm or static, just a screaming baby as you try and change the daiper.4. Use of AAA batteries in the parent unit. The device is large enough to use AA batteries that can then be recharged easily in the same charger as used for digital cameras, etc - but unfortunately you can't use them, because they've chosen to use AAA size. I don't want to fork out another 50 bucks for a AAA size charger - I'd rather use the far more common AA size.5. Critical switches are on the back of the base unit - so the unit is always on the shelf with its back facing out.6. Poorly labelled three way switches, e.g. ""Tic Off"" doesn't say whether it includes sound or not. Fair enough, easy to work out, but why cut corners this way? Have two two way switches - one for sound, one for movement and make it all clear.7. The ring on the top of the parent unit looks as though it will fit over a standard door knob - it doesn't though. Rather than a stylised angel's halo, I would have much preferred a functional belt clip.8. It would be nice if the ""tic"" feature could be turned on from the parent unit, just to give a little reassurance, and then turned off - but you can't. The switch is on the base unit, meaning you'll need to go into bub's room to activate it - sort of defeating the purpose.Having said this, we've found that the parent's unit receives the transmission from the base very well within the confines of our house, and we've yet to have a false alarm with the movement sensors... so in this respect, I think you can rely on the device despite its annoying drawbacks.Of course, it would be well worth investing in a first aid course for children should you be concerned enough regarding SIDS - as there would be little point in being alerted to the fact your child's heart and breathing had stopped if you didn't know how to perform infant CPR in an effort resuscitate them. That would be horrific.I wouldn't rebuy this device; there are other baby monitor/alarm systems that I'd investigate before getting this one. Maybe they don't work as well, but its worth investigating.",False
39,"Shelves are paper thin, they would not hold anything beyond a small 6 oz bottle of shampoo. Support area for the baby is too flimsy, we were afraid to put the baby there. The actual changing pad that comes with it is very thin, less than 0.5"" thick, but the shape of it does not lend itself well to adding another pad. We returned this changing table. We did not feel it was worth the risk. I am a second-time mom and have a lot of experience with changing tables. It is worth it to spend more and get a quality piece of furniture.",False
40,"While the outer pockets are nice, the main space inside is very small. This bag would be okay for running to the grocery store but if you are going to be out of the house for longer than that it just isn't practical. Also pretty expensive considering that lack of space. I did like the messenger bag style, but not enough to keep it.",False
41,"After grandma and grandpa accidentally drove to their home 2 hours away with our son's Brtitax Roundabout carseat (which we love)in their car, we decided to do some looking around for a second carseat. I found the good reviews on Consumers' on this seat, so decided to give this one a try. Well, after 2 days, I am looking forward to exchanging it for the Britax Marathon seat. While I was really hoping this one was going to work, I knew the minute it took my husband 45 minutes to install it in our car that we might have problems. The first annoying feature is how the tether strap installs to the anchor in your car--you have to adjust the strap first and then install it--and it is impossible to tighten once it's anchored on. The other annoying thing is, like everyone else has said, how easily the straps twist (especially by the thighs)--very trying on one's patience!!! The straps seem to be made of a lighter nylon than the straps on the Britax, so they constantly twist. The third annoying thing is the mechanism to tighten the harness once the child is in the seat. There is a lever you pull up on and it clicks and you must re-pull it a million times to properly tighten the harness. On the Britax, the strap pulls easily, making it a breeze to tighten.I am giving this seat 2 stars because of the Consumer Reports review stating it is a safe seat (the Britax seat is also rated highly, just a lot more expensive). My husband and I agree that safety, of course, is most important, but forget it with this seat--it's way too frustrating!!! Needless to say, we are going to pay more and get the Britax which we know is safe, and a lot easier to use!!!!!! I only wish car seat manufacturers would practice taking a child in and out numerous times to iron out the kinks that are so obvious to parents.",False
42,"I was SOOO happy with this when I first got it as a gift.. I thought we had got the ONE set that would work with no problems.. I was right, for about a month, then it started making weird beeping noises and the video got lots of static and the picture kept flipping... and I didn't have a tv or phone on anywhere near it! Save the money and get a reliable non tv monitor.",False
43,"This swing does not recline, so if your baby cannot completely sit up on their own, they slump down or tip to the side. When they tip to the side, the little hanging fish hit them in the face. There are also delightful little fish swimming on the sides of this device. When your child leans over to explore, their little heads get stuck between the fixed post and the swinging arm and get banged over and over. The only nice, safe feature is the lights. Do not buy this Swing. Buy something safer.",False
44,"The problem with this lock is that it doesn't have a hinge, so every time you open the fridge door, you apply pressure against the adhesive side that is glued to the side of the fridge. After a a few uses, it peels off and the adhesive is no longer effective. Its a good idea that addresses a real need but the design needs refinement. At the very least, they need to use a better quality glue that withstands the wear.",False
45,"I wish I'd read some reviews on this sippy before I bought it, but as I picked it up at Walmart for $2 I wasn't really thinking too hard about it. It was cute and I'd seen a lot of toddlers with these cups at playgroups.The straw is hard to thread back through after cleaning, and the last thing you want when your toddler has decided she's thirsty is to faff around with a fiddly straw.The biggest drawback is the spray factor. Liquid pools in the top portion of the straw, you close it and then when you open it - SPRAY! Milk flies through the air. It's a very messy cup. I wish I hadn't wasted the $2 and just gotten her anotherMunchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cup, Colors May Vary, 10 Ouncethat I know doesn't spray everywhere.",False
46,"I bought this stroller when we no longer needed the double stroller. I always thought the double was large, heavy, and hard to move around. Amazingly, this stoller was just as hard, if not harder to pick up. It does not close very well and when closed, is huge. The front wheel lock broke within the first week and I have since put putty in to fill the hole and keep it from locking. Again, within the first week, the cover for the storage compartment on top broke off. I am very frustrated that I spent the money on this and did not go with a McClaren as I had originally planned to do. My final complaints, the recline is not upright enough - your child will have to lay back - and the stroller does not come apart to allow you to wash it (with the light colored fabric, the stains are very apparent). I do not reccomend this stroller!",False
47,"This was very high on my wish list. I knew I wanted this and was very excited about it. However, the first night didn't go well with this. First of all, it is hard to determine how much water is needed to warm the bottle. I tried filling the little cups up all the way, 1/2 way.. I never found the 'correct amount' and I used this for 1 week. Then, the cooler section has a top that fits over the bottles, freeze packs... well that top is VERY HARD to line up and fit back on the unit. I tried NO KIDDING FOR ABOUT 2 minutes to put the top back on ... If it doesn't fit around on all edges it won't sit flush and keep in the cold. I finally gave up... this happened several times until I finally decided that this product wasn't worth the time or money. I was so disappointed!",False
48,"It's really cute to look at, but we were hoping that is choop would be useful.The raspberry part of the teether is way too big for our three-month-old's mouth. She gags and chokes with the red part of the teeether in her mouth.She's teething already and we've been looking around for something for her to gnaw on besides me (ouch).This teether is not useful to us. Save your money and try something else, unless you just want a ""cute"" baby item to decorate your house.",False
49,Munchkin didn't give us a warm glow...the lid to the warmer stopped closing/latching after just a few days. Wipeys easily dried out quickly and we found ourselves spending almost as much time caring for our wipey warmer as we did our newborn. Now after about 2 months the product doesn't even warm our wipeys! Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.,False
