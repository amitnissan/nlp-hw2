0,"We are happy with this purchase. The chair was not difficult to assemble and seems like it will be a nice piece to have as our baby boy grows up. Because it is a toddler rocker, it is a bit wide, so our son ends up tilting a bit to the side since he isn't wide enough for the chair yet and isn't quite strong enough to sit straight on his own. The recline and upright angles aren't very different from each other, but they work just fine.",True
1,"this stuff has saved my son from severe diaper rash.. For wipes, I use a non-alcholic witch hazel and use cotton balls.. it's really is amazing.. but i wish it came in a bigger tube!",True
2,"Great, great first toy. I have twins, and this has been a great mat for them to discover new things to do, such as grabbing, feeling, etc. It also helps them immensely with tummy time. Instead of getting frustrated, my girls look at the vibrant colors or the mirror on their tummies while lifting their heads. Fabulous gift!",True
3,"This is a very handy product to have. It has it's own carry case, which is a great plus. It's perfect for traveling to grandparents or even hotels.",True
4,"Love the stroller. Bought it because my husabnd is 6'4"" and had problems kicking all other strollers when trying to push. The Peg Perego has a stroller with adjustable handles for a tall/average height couple but it only changes the height a couple inches versus the Maclaren change of three inches. The stroller is lightweight, easy to fold and looks to be comfy. My only complaint is no adult cup holder and when you put one on it usually gets messed up while folding. Not a big deal but worth mentioning. I got mine in red for MUCH less than list price after searching internet. (Really liked the lilac but it was $100 more and I did not think a color was worth that much more money)",True
5,"I was a little hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews, but my 2 1/2 month old loves it and we haven't had any problems with leakage or anything. The flaps are a little pointless for her, but other than that it's really cool! I think it is absolutely worth the money!",True
6,"We bought this booster seat for our 4 year old, very slim daughter. Since she weighs 30 pounds I was looking for a very safe seat for her. She LOVES this seat. She feels like such a big kid. After using it for several weeks now, I feel very good about how the seat belt itself is not too high, and the comfort of the seat. She loves to unbuckle it herself when we get to a location and tells me the seat is very comfortable. It has been extremely easy to install and move around when we need to, and I am very happy with this purchase. The only possible negative I can think of is that you have to pay a little more for the girl print. I still don't get that part. She loves the colors, and I love how sturdy it is compared to the other boosters we have used. I would definitely recommend this product to others (and have done so).",True
7,"We purchased a jumperoo at the advice of friends, as our little one needed to do more than lay on her back or have tummy time while playing. We were glad to have selected the Rainforest Jumperoo--She loves it! She weighs about 20 lbs, so you have to be careful to get her feet through the two footholes. The seat is just right, although I don't know how much longer she will be able to get into and out of it, but it works fine, and she jumps excitedly for long periods of time (not just a 5-minute gig). It's nice for me when I need to do some work in kitchen.My husband wishes they made one for adults...grin!",True
8,"I bought this pail when I had my second child. I used the Dekor before and decided to try something different. This pail is great. It is very easy to use and doesn't smell at all. At first, my two year old decided to put everything in it because it is so fun to use, but she soon learned that only dirty diapers go in it. The only drawback is the the shoot does get pretty dirty and needs to be cleaned once in a while.",True
9,"We love this booster seat. It's simple, narrow (a plus for us, as we have three seats that need to fit) and the chest strap holders are attached. Absolutely love this booster!",True
10,We could not live without this. We traveled a lot with our daughter when she was between 4-10 months and this was essential for carrying her around airports to keep her safe and our hands free.,True
11,"Great for 18 month old. Cleans easy w/ no seams or crevices to worry about. Lifts up and sets in easily. Love the rubber around the foot print to stop from sliding or ""driving"" potty around tile floor. Very lightweight but doesn't tip over easily when little ones are practicing getting up and down. I have two - one for each floor of the house.",True
12,"We too, were thinking that we'd later have to use a rental or buy the more expensive pump but ,this one really does the trick. It's awesome, I take it to work with me and I'm able to store the milk right in the case. It's also quiet enough that everyone doesn't have to know when I'm pumping. This is a good buy, don't waste your money on the more expensive pumps.",True
13,"These bottles frustrated me at first, but once I got them &quot;down pat&quot; they have been great and I think they really do keep the air out and keep gas to a minimum. The early frustrations: the nipple is a little too big for a newborn, although he got the hang of it. The hole in Stage One is too small, even for a newborn, and made him suck WAY too hard..so hard, it left a mark on his upper lip!! So I made the hole a little bigger with a red hot needle tip. The bottom plastic piece (the &quot;vent&quot; piece) is a little tricky to get in place properly -- you really have to dig in there and make sure it's right or the bottom will leak (my husband still can't get this part right)...if the top ring/nipple leaks just pull the nipple up a little and adjust the tension of the ring. Sounds like a lot of work, and feels like a lot of work the first few days home when your starving infant is howling to eat, but once you get into the groove, they are great bottles. Playtex should make a few improvements, and also provide clearer directions with the bottles. I somewhat regret not starting my baby out on the Playtex Nurser Disposable system, though. It's too late now, because he is used to the nipple on the VentAir and wants nothing to do with several versions of the Nurser nipple, including the new silicone version that isn't as &quot;square-like&quot; as the latex nipple.",True
14,I recieved this pump from my hospital when I had my baby. I have to say I have two electric pumps one medela and one playtex and they all take out milk about the same. I use this pump when my baby is sleeping and I need to pump out some milk. The handle is kind of weird but it works really well.I prefer using the pump without the flexishield.I think any standard bottle screws on to this pump I use my medela bottles on this pump too. I recommend this pump for anyone who wants a easy to use and easy to clean product,True
15,"I purchased the Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame to use w/ my SnugRide 32 infant car seat. The stroller frame works just like a snap 'n go, is easy to put together and has a large basket just as pictured. It's lightweight and easy to get the car seat in and out of. I know I will get a lot of use out of this item once baby arrives. Amazon had the best price, very quick delivery and no hassles.",True
16,"This has to be one of the best strollers ever. I have the stroller and matching car seat/carrier as a travel system. Easy open, easy close, and very easy rolling (smooth as roller blades). Grandma is 76 years old and has no problem managing this stroller - she wishes she had strollers that rolled this well for her 4 kids. Lightweight for a full-size stroller. Very durable - still looks new after 16 months. Canopy is great for sun and wind. Large, easy to access basket. Boot is great in winter - throw a warm blanket on their legs under the boot and you don't have to bundle them up like the Stay-Puff marshmallow man. The reversible handles are great when your infant has outgrown the carrier but you still want them to face you in the stroller. New snack tray is a great addition, and as always with Peg Perego, new features can be retrofitted to the older models. Worth every penny.",True
17,"Beautiful piece of furniture, but my toddler grabbed a drawer on the side and tried to climb up to see in her drawer, and it bent the sliding rods. My husband had to man handle it so it would go back in the dresser. Other than that it's great- fits much more than the set I bought at R2G, and less expensive.",True
18,"This item is great! I bought this instead of the Bumbo seat for a few reasons.1.) This one came with a tray, toy, and 2 place mats for cheaper than I could have gotten the Bumbo seat with its accessories.2.) I like how when my daughter sits in the BebePod, her legs are comfortably pointing downward instead of straight out like the Bumbo seat.3.) I love the Kiwi color!!Others complained about a chemical smell - I never had that.A couple things I wish were a little different:1.) I wish the backrest was not so rounded at the top and I like how the Bumbo seat has ""arm rests"" in a way.2.) The BebePod is quite slippery and it looks like the Bumbo seat is not. (I've never even touched a Bumbo seat though so I don't know for sure.)3.) While the Bebepod is foam, it's a little harder than I expected. I'm curious to know if the Bumbo seat is any softer. On the other hand, I understand it can't be too soft or it wouldn't be safe enough for a baby to sit in it.But this product was great for what I was looking for! My daughter is 14 weeks old and so far seems to enjoy it. She's not quite coordinated enough yet to play with the toy, but I'm sure she'll love it.******UPDATE*********We absolutely LOVE the bebePod! Our daughter is 8 months old now and it's one of her favorite places to be! She ABSOLUTELY LOVES the toy it comes with and spends a long time contently playing with it! She gets so excited when she sees it coming!VERY HAPPY with our decision to purchase this over the Bumbo seat. We love how the tray slides in instead of just sits on top like the bumbo tray. So far, the toy has yet to be pulled out of the tray by our daughter, which is something I was worried about.I put her in it while I shower and get ready for the day, giving me all the time in the world!!BUY IT! You'll LOVE it!",True
19,"Length:: 0:36 MinsOur newborn used to hate tummy time until my sister got us this as a gift! Now he loves loves tummy time. This is him doing TT at 3 weeks. The best part is that this can be used for multiple things, like making the stroller cozy for walks. It is very soft and cozy. I wish I had one in my size!My sister also got us the lambskin wash too. The directions for maintaining the lambskin doesn't require it but it seems like a good idea to use. You should wash it once a month.",True
20,"I bought this for my 14 month old who likes to swing a leg over the crib rail like she's trying to get out. I hope this keeps her from being able to climb out for a while. Also, it gives her extra warmth without having to worry about keeping a blanket on top of her.",True
21,"Good price for a cute cover for your boppy. Not quite as soft as the plush covers, but totally reasonable softness--like a crib sheet. This design is not mommy-chic but it is baby-cute.",True
22,"This is similar to Avent wide neck bottle but I got this because this claim to be Bisphenal A free. Although BPA is not a officially banned, why take a chance. It's a little more expensive than other bottles; about $10 each. The only con is that there is an air venting piece which means more to clean but much easier compared to the Dr. Brown tubes. I'm glad that I could boil the bottles knowing that no chemicals are leaked out.",True
23,"I have an electric stove and for the big knobs it worked perfect so no one can just push it in and turn them on, but for the smaller knobs on the stove I was not able to use these. I would love for them to make these for smaller knobs as well, but for now i can just pull the smaller knobs off so little hands can't turn them.",True
24,"About a year ago, we looked at front swivel wheel jogging strollers. We wanted one with a supportive seat that would allow our son to sit more upright than most jogging strollers allowed. We also wanted one with a child tray. We opted to get the Instep Safari TT Single Stroller (which I think is the same as the Schwinn Safari TT Swivel Stroller) over one of the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Strollers. We were able to buy the Instep much cheaper than the Jeep. Also, the Jeep we saw had speakers for a cd player which we had no interest in using. We have just recently purchased a used 2003 Jeep stroller. For our current off-road, non-jogging purposes, this is working out better.I would like to offer our comparison of the Instep/Schwinn Safari and the Jeep. There seems to be a few choices in Jeep models. Ours is used and I don't know which we have. Therefore, these are just basic guidelines.We've taken both strollers around a neighborhood with sporadic sidewalks and no curb cutouts and both have handled the mixed/rough terrain well. We've also walked on the university campus where there are small (2') hills and both strollers go up and down them fine.My main complaints with the Instep, and what I like about the Jeep, are little things. The cupholders are so shallow that bottles of water fall over. The child tray is not removable. When our son falls asleep we have to lift him out over the tray. The sunshade is beyond stupid. We live in Arizona and the Instep shade provides no protection from the sun. It actually curves upwards. We bought a Kiddopotamus sunshade. Although it provides ample sun protection, our son must essentially look out a tube. I don't know if the Jeep sunshade will be better, we haven't used it for daytime walks yet. However, it seems bigger and does not curve up and let the sun in. I will address the bad Instep brakes later.The Instep is bigger and the seat for the child is roomier. However, there is more head clearance space under the Jeep Canopy. I wonder if the foot rest on the Jeep will be outgrown faster than the footrest on the Instep.The seat on the Jeep seems better padded. The one we bought was FILTHY when we got it and it cleaned up easily. I had been certain it would be covered in stains, but it looks brand new. The Instep has a thin seat cover that can be removed for washing. However, it is velcroed in place. When our son sits down, we have to hold the pad in place or it slips and wads up underneath him.There are reflectors attached all over the Jeep. The Instep has no reflectors that I've ever noticed.The handle on the Instep is adjustable, so you can make it taller. You can also position it facing backwards and be further back from the stroller. This is probably advantageous for joggers. The Jeep is okay height for me 5'7"" and I think my 6' husband is okay, but much taller and the Jeep handle might be too short.The back wheels on our Instep are bigger than the rear wheels on the Jeep. That might make a difference for someone who jogs. I haven't jogged with either stroller.Our Instep has a locking front wheel as does our Jeep. I don't know if all models of each brand lock or not.The brake system on the Jeep is better. Although they both have foot brakes that interact with the rear wheels, the Instep partially falls into place when you go over bumps. You then get a bump-bump-bump rhythm in the stroller. My husband actually stretched a bungie cord between the handle bar and the foot bar to prevent this. I haven't noticed the Jeep brake falling into place.I like the cargo basket better on the Jeep because it is bigger and much more accessible. Another advantage of the Jeep is for our son. He loves to push the stroller like he does shopping carts. He grabs the horizontal bar at the back of the stroller and pushes. On the Instep, this is the brake so he sets the brake. On the Jeep, he grabs and pushes with the cargo basket so he does not set the brake. The cargo basket on the Instep is very inconvenient. It's small and it is hard to get stuff in and out. I suspect for someone jogging, they would collide with the Jeep basket but not with the Instep basket.We've never used the Instep as a jogger, but rather as an off-road stroller. Now that I have used both, I think the Jeep is better for off-road general stroller, but the Instep is probably better for jogging. I still like the cup holders, sunshade, brakes, and removable tray of the Jeep MUCH better and think the Instep would be a superior stroller if it had those. Although I like the jeep cargo basket for my purpose, I think the Instep cargo basket that doesn't stick back, the handle that folds backwards, and the large rear wheels could possibly make a difference for a jogger.As of this writing, amazon does not offer the front swivel Jeep. However, it can be ordered from other sites. Some models are as cheap as $100 at some retailers.",True
25,"Great iteam,no odor ,I keep it in the babys room no bad smell you could use regular trash bags no necessary needs to buy special ones.A friend gave it to us cause his baby dont need it and still work as new...I was thinking to buy it at first when i saw it at the store...",True
26,I decorated my entire nursery with this theme and am so pleased I could not have found a better set than this one...I highly recommend this set to everyone...,True
27,"We've used this monitor for 4 months now.Likes:- very sensitive. Went off only once with baby in bed (because the sensor pad had been moved to one side of the crib after changing the sheets and the baby was on the other side of the crib)- can turn off movement sensor to just use sound monitor- gives me some extra ease of mind even though my baby is low risk of SIDS- has two receiving units- long enough range that I can take the receiving unit outside- receiving unit lights up when baby cries (nice for use while taking a shower)Dislikes:- only has 2 channels. Receiving units pick up static almost all the time from lights, computers, cell phone, you name it. However, we have not picked up our nextdoor neighbor's baby monitor.- hard to turn off receiving unit without loud static noise (not good for middle of the night feedings when you want your spouse to stay asleep)- need board over springs on crib for movement sensor pad- very senstive - the baby's ceiling fan on high moves the mobile, which is attached to the crib, enough that the sensor picks up movement even with the baby not in the crib. Also, adults walking around the nursery causes the sensor pad to pick up movement.- alarm goes off when you pick up the baby and forget to switch off the movement sensor",True
28,"The bag was a little stiff at first. The Graco car seat fits in great. It was easy to put in and remove from bag, it comes with a strap if you need to tote it around.",True
29,This is a cute curtain although it is an orange/pink rather than the pink it shows in the picture. My problem with it was that in the description it is supposed to be 84 inches long and it is only 55 inches long. Now I have to order a second one so that it will be long enough to cover my window. It does look nice in the window though.,True
30,"This is a great gate! Super easy to install! Unlike other reviewers, ours makes little to no noise when it closes. And our 10 month old son has been able to walk out of it without tripping over the bar across the bottom. The gate is very study and has a better ""look"" than many of the other baby gates. We are definitely pleased!",True
31,"This bag fits our Keyfit carseat and our Chicco umbrella stroller, which is nice because you don't have to pay for it when you check it! Wish the bag was padded but it is good otherwise.",True
32,"Our baby LOVES this bed! The attachable toy hanger is great for suspending little toys above her so she can bat and play with them. The bed is very sturdy and easy to open and close and comes with a duffel style bag for transporting. Very light weight, easy to move around. Colors go very well together. Great product!",True
33,"My 2 month old baby absolutely adores this mobile. Whenever we put her under it (it's attached to her crib, but she still sleeps in a cradle), she stares up at it with great interest. Even better, it often elicits smiles and laughs!Many reviewers are disappointed that the mobile doesn't move, but, personally, I don't think that's a problem. Sometimes I move the mobile for her, but it doesn't seem necessary. She's perfectly content when it's stationary.Here are some of the downsides:1) It didn't come with all of the pictures shown :/ We got two sets of the same pictures. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or if this is what everyone gets.2) Switching out the pictures is not easy--the holes are small and the cards are not flexible.3) The mounting arm, a huge chunk of plastic, is rather unattractive. It was, initially, kinda painful to install this in my daughter's otherwise adorable (and nearly plastic free) nursery. But. . . she does love it, so I'm over it.It's not a perfect mobile, but I'd still highly recommend it.",True
34,"I like that the towel is big, soft and absorbent. The only thing I don't like is that the monkey applique is rough and we can't really dry our son's hair with that portion since it's too rough.",True
35,"Why even wait to see if your baby is gassy...try these bottles. Most people complain about all of the parts, but there really aren't many and it's worth the few extra seconds per bottle to clean the additional pieces.",True
36,"This cover is great and we use it every day with our daughter. It really is quite warm - when our daughter is in the Bjorn her front side stays toasty, and this cover really keeps the heat in so we don't have to overdress her. In cold weather we just put on her jacket and a hat, and then this cover makes everything toasty. I only wish we could use it longer, as she's getting too tall!",True
37,"i loved this item, i purchased the sling which i also like, but was given this item, and used it a lot too. it keeps your arms free while the baby is very secure even when cant hold head up yet. and you can finally get some things done in the house. great back support, and baby loves to bounce around seeing all the action while being close to mommy. dont buy the more expensive designer ones, waste of money.",True
38,"Huggies are my number one diaper,they amaze me. They are super absorbent and my grandson has NEVER had diaper rash. That to me is amazing.",True
39,"I LOVE this product! We have used it in our king size bed and it is great!! No concerns as the baby is totally safe and she can smell me which helps her not only fall asleep better, but also stay asleep. We had tried putting in her carrier to sleep(which I hated doing) because the playard she was sleeping in was just too hard, I think, so once we got her to sleep she would wake up when we set her down. Now she either sleeps between us in our bed or in the Safe and Secure Sleeper inside her playard. Since it has a little mattress it's more comfy. Plus we use it to get her to sleep downstairs, then just move her (in the sleeper) up to her playard without her waking up. I only wish I had found this product earlier as my daughter is now 2 months old.",True
40,"I bought these so I could freeze breast milk. I wasn't sure if the ice trays that came with the fridge were bpa free so wanted to get something that was. Having the lid is a bonus. The only downside to this product is that even when filled to the brim each cube is only about 2/3 an oz but once you know that it's easy to plan accordingly. For just freezing breast milk, you don't really need a 2pk, but if I decide to make my own baby food I think the second one will come in handy.",True
41,"I bought this monitor at the advice of a friend. I am so happy that I did. Originally we were going to get one of those camera monitors, but I am so happy we changed our mind. I love the sensor board that goes underneath the crib mattress. It gives me such piece of mind. I don't have to go in there and check to be sure she is breathing every 10 minutes. I know that if she should stop, the monitor would sound an alarm. I know that it works because I have already removed her from the crib and forgot to shut off the sensor section of the monitor and the alarm is loud. I try everything I can to prevent SIDS. I believe that this monitor is just one more precaution I can take. I would strongly suggest this to anyone.",True
42,"I really loved the quality, haven't washed yet so I don't know. Ordered blue they sent me off white didn't have time to exchange since it was a gift",True
43,"We bought this jumper and Olivia really liked it but only for short periods of time. For something free-standing there is not enough toys to keep her entertained. She doesn't even bounce in it that much anymore at 7 months. We then purchased an older model that attaches to the door frame and she went nuts in that. I don't know why but she stays in that MUCH longer and seems to have alot more fun. So if you can find a nice one, I'd get the ""johnny jump-up"" model before spending on this. We found a new one for $10.00 at a second hand store.",True
44,"The play mat actually works great for our room. I like the colors, the thickness, the smell wasn't really strong, but had a ""new"" smell for a couple days.To help save on cost we bought them used through Amazon. And they actually appeared in almost new condition... Unfortunately I wanted two packages to combine them together to make a larger play area. It appeared from the picture that would be easy to do. However, when received we got two different versions of this product. One was exactly as we planned. But the other had finished corners so we couldn't attach them and they also had bigger connectors then the other one. Plus the colors were off and didn't look right.We are returning the one that didn't match, hopefully we'll get what we intended in the end.",True
45,"My baby and I both love these bottles. I started her on the playtex nurser but got tired of buying the drop ins and the wide nipple made her dribble milk out of her mouth.Since using these bottles she has not spit up once and she is less gassy. I have read that some of the reviewers claim the nipples dont work... there is a trick. The nipples are designed to be sucked at the tip not the base so when she is sucking on the nipple, I gently pull it out of her mouth and she gobbles it down.They are not difficult to clean. I just take them apart and throw them in a dishwasher basket and reassemble.",True
46,"We purchased this carseat cover for our third child, and I wish so much we would have had one of these with our two older children! This cover is the BEST--I cannot think of anything I would want to change about it. There are slits in the back that accomodate carseat and stroller straps; and the slits velcro close to keep cold air out if you are using the cover as a simple bunting. The fabric is really soft, and it has a removable hood to cover baby's face when bringing him out in the cold Minnesota weather. And you can also use your carseat's sun-visor with this model, unlike some the others I've used. This Wrap-n-Ride is also a lot less expensive than some other covers I've seen, which makes it a great value too. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a baby in cold weather.",True
47,I got this for my daughter and we've had it about 7 months. She's 11 months now and finally can use it without putting a pillow behind her. But it's very nice and we'll be able to use it for our next baby.,True
48,"I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him. This tub is great, I even use it at home. I started using this tub when my son was 6 months, he is now 9 months old. Now that he sits up on his own, it's a lot easier to bathe him. I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly, all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat. If you travel, it's a great idea to get an inflatable tub, it's portable, and quite sturdy.",True
49,"My son is fascinated with this mobile. He smiles and coos as he stares up at the pictures. I love that you can change out the pictures to keep it fresh and new for the baby. My only complaint is that the cards are a little hard to change out, and some of the cards can't be moved down so the baby can see them. I wish all the cards had the middle slot to put them in the baby's eye line. Overall, though, this is a great mobile and I would reccomend it to anyone.",True
50,"I don't mind the odd shape of this shawl so much, and the thumb loops top and bottom are kind of handy. However, the thumb loops are absolutely necessary, because my daughter could easily pull it off otherwise (because it was so short). It also gets VERY dark in there unless I continually hold the top loop away from my body, which makes my arm tired pretty quickly.I went back to using a light-colored large baby blanket - it provides better coverage, and my daughter doesn't try to throw it off, because she can still see.",False
51,"One day recently, at 11pm, long after we put out 10 month-old to bed in his crib, we hear ""The sun is shining..."" coming from his playroom. Then 11pm, 12am, 1am... you get the idea. We have had the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker for since Christmas. His interest is minimal for this toy. I would like to say it's educational but I'm in reality on the fence about that statement. It hardly keeps his attention, and the voice is hard to understand - so how can he really learn? All he cares to do is eat the phone and pull the shapes of the mounts. I thought it was a good toy from the description and design so I requested it as a Christmas present. I can say now after 3-months of use, I don't like it much and wish I had asked for something else.",False

Do not buy this, it will only make you mad and be most unpleasant for your baby.",False
53,"I requested this sheet on my registry. When I received it I was quite disappointed at how flimsy the sheet was. I also didn't care for how easily it comes off of the pad. I ended up putting a blanket down for my baby to lay on because I didn't trust that the sheet would stay put. Also, given how thin it is, it would take only a few minutes for a pool of drool to end up on the pad itself. I was very disappointed.",False
54,"We bought this product for a 2000-mile road trip with our 14-month old. We found it was too thick to be helpful in keeping her head propped up in a good position as she slept to prevent wheezing. If we put it around the back or sides of her neck, her head would fall forward and her breathing wouldn't be smooth. If we put it around the front of her neck, it wouldn't stay put or she would pull it off. On the positive side, it worked reasonably well for me and my 16.5-inch neck, but we will be looking into something more wedge-shaped that goes around the front of the neck for the next trip with our toddler.",False
55,"I think this could be a good monitor except for the 2 way communication feature. Just as with many monitors you can pick up interferance on the parents end,but since the childs end is also a reciever it picks up interferace as well.

57,"My kids are 32 months apart and this stroller did not work well for us. My 2 year old hated sitting in the back seat. The front seat poked her in the back when the car seat was in it, she hated riding backwards and she had no where to nap if she was tired...running errands was awful!! The carseat converter was hard to take on and off (I pinched my fingers all the time). The front seat hardly reclines and is not soft at all...which means no napping in this stroller! It is bulky and heavy. I sold it after 6 months and bought the maclaren twin triumph stroller (which I love).",False
58,Out of all the baby products I have received this tub HAS TO BE THE WORST! The major problem with it is it leaks all over the place. The directions are so hard to understand in the first place and it was more trouble than it was worth to put together! I have used it a couple of times and am ready to throw it out the window! I will be investing in another tub - hopefully one that does not leak!!!!!,False
59,"My husband often dreams of how he will dispose of this monitor. One of his biggest complaints with this monitor is that the lowest volume setting is very quiet and the next volume level up is very loud. From there, it just gets even louder. Most every sound is distorted and a bit frightening. Our first one broke and we had to have it replaced... he thinks we should have just bought a different model a long time ago. That said, this monitor has really helped to teach him patience, so it can't be all that bad! ;-)",False

63,"I really wanted to like this carseat but after 4 months of using it, I can't recommend it at all. With my older daughter, we used the Graco Snugride which was great over time - lightweight, clips into everything, good shade, roomy - but she hated it for the first couple of months and we thought it wasn't comfortable enough. So this time around, we looked for a carseat that looked comfy. This one certainly seemed to fit the bill - the fabrics are high quality, there is a lot of padding, and it includes the Mother's Lap insert which seemed great. I do think that the carseat is well padded and comfortable in that sense. Unfortunately, all of the padding and especially the temperpedic-style foam padding makes my daughter extremely hot. She is dripping in sweat when we take her out of the carseat. Overheating is very unsafe for newborns.It is a constant annoyance that the carseat won't clip into shopping carts and I have to set it in the body of the shopping cart leaving no room for items. The sunshade is way too small and doesn't cover her at all and also comes detached all the time. Whenever you try to rotate the carseat handle, the sunshade is in the way and I end up trying to cram it under the handle and then it comes detached.All in all, I have been extremely disappointed by this seat and if she weren't already almost out of it, I would have switched back to Graco.",False
64,"This is the worst. We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months. Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor. It isn't even in the same league. With the voice activation feature you hear nothing, I repeat nothing, unless the sound registers over a certain decibel. Amazing!! It was definitely worth the $50. Just wish we never registered for this product.",False
65,"The material used in the current line of Peg Perego car seats is neither breathable nor absorbant. My daughter sweats terribly. Her head is dripping when I take her out of a climate-controlled car.

The manager suggested I sell the car seat and stroller on eBay or at a consignment shop! I would not subject other children to this product's numerous faults.",False
66,"The idea of a hands-free gate is great; however, the plastic foot pedal on this gate broke in the first few weeks after installation. We fixed the pedal with duct tape and were able to use the gate for a couple months thereafter. Now, one of the two plastic tabs that secure/lock the gate closed is jammed inside of the gate and the remaining tab is too flimsy to hold. I will return it for a different one as soon as possible!!",False
67,"I really like the functionality of this high chair. It came with all the pieces and was easy to put together--it is sturdy. It is also pretty scratched up and had some decent gauges in the wood. The finish of the seat was rough and low quality. We would have returned it, but we needed it ASAP and were in a jam.",False
68,"I was going on a trip with my 3 month old across the county and bought this for the plane ride. As far as heating bottles, this does not work at all. You have to boil the bag after each use and let it cool down completely before trying to use it again which is a real hassle. It also activates when you don't want it to. Most importantly, it doesn't heat the bottle at all. It's a neat product, and I would recomend this for using as cordless heating pad for your sore muscles...but not for heating bottles.",False
69,"This wireless video system arrived and seemed perfect...until I turned it on. Our house is full of 2.4Ghz stuff like cordless phones and a wireless network. Sad to say the receiver didn't function well at all in this environment--so many static lines and jumps that it was virtually worthless. Other than the fact that it was not designed to operate with simple wirelss items that the majority of American homes now have, it does seem to be a sweet little wireless video system. Perhaps if you live in a vacuum in the middle of no where it would be perfect to keep an eye on the local wildlife... :O)",False

71,"I can't believe so many products, for babies' sensitive private parts, have shea butter! You do not know if your child is going to be nut-allergic...so don't use products on the child that contain shea butter! I am allergic to nuts and any personal care product (lotion, wipes, etc) that contains shea butter gives me horrible hives. If your child gets a fierce diaper rash using these, consider the possibilty of an allergy..or better yet, don't use nut products like shea butter (which comes from the shea NUT) on babies when you don't know if they will be allergic...exposing them repeatedly so early on to nuts may trigger a nut allergy due to ""system overload.""",False

(See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.) Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay. Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should. CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling. Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store. Be sure to avoid model 14565!",False
73,"Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed.",False
74,"My son is 2 1/2 and this potty has been a nightmare for us. First, it did have a tendency to go off at all times of the day and night, and 2nd, the splash guard is not tall enough or secure enough. I can't even begin to count the times that I've turned around and seen him chewing on the guard he's removed or how often urine has shot across the bathroom because his penis is pointing 1 cm off of 'straight ahead'. On the bright side, it's comfortable for him to sit on and mine has never leaked, but that just may be because the urine never quite makes it in the receptacle.",False
75,"I own one of these things and have used it once. To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain. Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks. It is also not very lightweight. I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down. I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road. And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water. Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing. I wouldn't buy it again.",False
76,I dont know if it's just me or what but I found this belt to provide no extra support what so ever. Save your money or invest into a belt thats worth it.,False
77,"My daughter had an allergic reaction to this product--a rash on her lower back the morning after she wore the Goodnite the first night. We tried again the next night, and the rash became worse (she stayed dry all night both nights). We tried using the Goodnites a few nights after that, putting a pair of underwear on her first and then putting it over to protect her, but the Goodnite caused a rash anywhere it touched her lower back where the underwear wasn't protecting her. Just want to add that my daughter has never actually had an allergy to anything before that I know of, and we've used a lot of different brands of diapers.Also, don't be fooled that this will look like underwear in any way, this looks like a soft fluffy pull-up. When we took them out of the wrapper, my 2 year-old said ""that's a diaper! that's a pull-up"" and my 4 year-old was only willing to wear it because there is a picture of an older girl on the package.",False
78,"I tried this product based on the convincing positive reviews. I am very disappointed. This thing is so hard to operate one-handed. I don't like to leave the baby on the changing table for even a second, and with this device you have to have both hands to push diaper in, and then twist. I just set the diaper half way in now &amp; hope that I remember to push it through, and twist it when I have a spare minute, but it's a pain. I know a bunch of other mothers who also have used the genie, and were not impressed. I wish I would have taken their advice in the first place.",False
79,"I love this brand of bottles but, buy the thinner bottles. The wide Dr Brown bottles cost more and were to big for my daughter. The other nipples were better on the thinner, tall Dr. Brown bottles. Easier for a newborn to eat from the thinner bottles",False
80,This item looks great but is cheaply made and isnt even safe for your baby. The red wipes case transfers red color to all your wipes and when you report the issue to the company they do not care. They delete your posts on their facebook wall if it doesnt favor them. Do not buy this product or any skip hop product for that matter. Your baby deserves to use products made by a company that will stand behind their product and that actually cares about the welfare of your baby.,False

83,"I bought these cups because I thought the idea of no valve was excellent....however, I quickly learned that while it may be a good idea, it was very poorly executed in these cups. I have purchased (and returned) 2 packs of 2 because all 4 leaked. I thought maybe the first set was just a fluke...Nope. These cups are NOT spill proof. They aren't even drip proof!

86,"This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out, and NO shower pull-up handle (look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations.) On top of that, this cover is too short for any of our spigots!One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover, the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front.This cover won't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle. If your spigot has a flat-top shower pull-up or it can be unscrewed, then perhaps you can make this work.AND it's too short! When the cover is on a spigot, the back of the cover won't meet the tile wall, which means it can't be caulked into place, which means it is easily bumped out of position, spewing water everywhere, or perhaps worse, falling off the spigot entirely. No good!This product should have been designed to accommodate more styles of spigots.",False

89,"The products don't come with a ""snack over lid"" or the lid. As a result of that, I had to use plastic wraps to cover the snack trap to prevent dirt/dust from going into the snack trap. I finally attempted to order the lids online and had trouble doing so because they have a very bad website. Well, I wrote and called and got no response from the company. What is the point of getting the snack trap if it doesn't come with lids? The product is poorly designed. I wish I didn't spend my money on it. What a waste!",False
90,"This monitor has a tendency to pick up interference from different appliances being used in the house. Fans, lights etc. Our big screen tv renders the product useless -it just puts out static.

91,"I'm the type of consumer who rarely writes a bad review, but these diapers deserve it, especially for being Pampers brand and not just a generic. The mesh inside the diaper sticks to one side and completely rips apart when you try to separate the mesh from the side of the diaper so that you can place your baby in it. Pampers is still a great brand, and we've never had a problem with them before, but steer clear of this particular product. Poorly designed and LOW quality.",False
92,This belt positioners is no replacement for the security and safety afforded by a federally certified booster seat. This belt positioner allows for too much movement on the part of the child and is not able to keep them properly positioned in the adult seat belt system.

93,"About two weeks after sending the last of my easy to use First Years baby gates to the Goodwill, we decided to get a puppy. I looked around for those same baby gates, but couldn't find any. I found this gate and, while it is absolutely hideous, it's was cheap, which is good since I didn't know how long I'd need it for.I realize some people here have found this gate easy to use, but I am not one of them. I can't imagine how people are able to operate it one handed. Sure, it's easy to unlatch and remove from the door frame one handed, but setting it back up is a challenge. Maybe it was just my particular gate, but it didn't slide easily AT ALL. It took quite a bit of effort to pull the one side out to make it larger, then I would have to carefully tap it down to the size I needed so it would fit the door frame again, since the four rubber stoppers prevented me from just slipping it back into the doorway. At first I thought it was just me, but even husband, a naval nuclear engineer, struggled with it...so that made me feel better. Again...it may just be our particular gate, but my experience with it has been mostly negative.In the end I'm glad I went cheap because we ended up not really needing it (puppy is kept in the bathroom at night with the door closed instead of a gate up), but we'll keep it around just in case. If you're planning on using this for a child, I say pass...unless you're going to put it up in a doorway and leave it there. In that case it's a great gate because it's so cheap. But it your planning on removing it frequently from wherever you put it, look elsewhere.",False
94,"Let me emphasize how HORRIBLE THE RECEPTION ON THIS THING IS!! We bought it a week ago and have been playing with it to get it to work without sounding like an static-filled air control tower. Moving it from place to place, etc. My husband and I have not rested well since we bought the damn thing. Last night we even got in an argument, half-asleep in the middle of the night because that stupid thing just flared up and got all loud and static around 2 a.m. Even if we turn on the PS2, the TV or god forbid talk on the phone or walk by it...forget it. Now, here we go again back to the store........don't waste your money!!",False
95,This chair is such a pain to move anywhere. I would like this chair fine if I didn't want to move it around my kitchen. The brakes are constantly being pushed down by the covers of the legs and I can't get it to roll. I don't personally use the brakes yet because my daughter doesn't move it. I have been trying to contact Graco to see if this is a common problem and what they will do to fix it.,False
96,"I set this gate up at the bottom of the stairs in my house, but from the start, it didn't feel very sturdy. The metal parts are nice, but the locking mechanism is mostly plastic, and made very poorly. I have needed to tighten the gate at least once each day during the four days it has been installed. If it is a little loose, it pops open with a little shaking, which my 18 month old has already done. We are shopping for a new gate.",False
97,I didn't think these bottles were that great. My child isn't collicky and doesn't have digestive problems so maybe I would rate this item differently if she were. I thought maybe she would burp or spit up less with these bottles compared to regular bottles but she didn't. Plus there are more parts to clean. My husband hated them after the first couple of tries but I wanted to give them a chance. So after a couple of weeks I also gave up on them and use them as regular bottles instead of attaching all the parts. Save your money and get a different brand.,False

Within 30 days, the fabric was ripping, it is lighter than most strollers for 2, yet this is not as convienient as it seemed. The wheels have to lock in certain positions, the basket is lightweight and very unaccessable and it does not have a kick bar (the bar in the back of the stroller to help position to go up curbs, the one that you lean your weight on). When the front is reclined, the child in the fronts feet and legs are being squished. The sun shades / hoods are not easily moved to position for shade.Amazon has agreed to take stroller back.. I'm extremely happy about that!!!I would not recommend this product at all..MOM of TWINS..",False

It did keep her warm, but it doesn't even go to the end of the car seat on either end, and my husband hates to try and buckle her in with it as he has a hard time find where straps have gone, its a good thing i don't think we will be using it long as shes over 6 months now.
