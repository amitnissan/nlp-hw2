0,"IF THIS TELEPHONE WILL HAVE CALLER ID. I THINK THAT WILL BUY OTHER.BECAUSE IS EASY TO OPERATE, PROGRAM Y BEAUTIFUL."
1,"I regularly use these labels to fulfill Amazon orders.they are expensive, but they never jam, they completely block out anything under the label and they always look good.they seem expensive for a label, but I never have any problems with them."
2,"After reading how Time Magazine hailed this album as album of the year, and how Rolling Stone gave it the rare five stars, I knew I had to pick it up. Not being a hip-hop fan usually, I was hooked when I popped this into my CD player. ""Golddigger"" and ""Heard 'Em Say"" easily topped my favorite chart on the album, with cameos I'd never see work anywhere else. ""Diamonds From Sierra Leone"" showed some of Kanye's grand creativity, being able to turn a James Bond-esque style song into a very attractive rap track.Big thumbs up for Mr. West, keep the great work coming!"
3,We used this cork for a Christmas craft. We die cut the cork and it worked great. It was exactly what we wanted. Great product
4,"Excellent scale that is perfect, small, portable and able to weigh up to 55lbs. GREAT DEAL!"
5,Handy but requires some practice in order to mount the label correctly. Mounting tool they sell for this label is useless.
6,I honestly love everything from Kanye because he always delivers. I haven't been disappointed from anyone of his CD's. It's more down to earth and less artsy then his newer stuff but I have to be honest that I like his older juvenile stuff better then the artsy stuff. The lyrics are better in the older stuff.
7,I received my calculator quicker than expected. It was what I was wanting. I bought a used one because it was olny amonth old and looks new. Thanks Amazon
8,"This is a great stand that does exactly what it says (keeps your computer in place at the right height) and also looks great. I've been using mine for several weeks and couldn't be happier. Minimalist design makes it a good match for the Macbook Pro. It's has a surprisingly sturdy construction and can be easily disassembled and packed away or transported, which is one of the main reasons I bought it. For those who say their computers have slipped off the rubber bars and fallen onto their desks, I can only think these people must be greasing the stand with oil before placing their computers atop, because I cannot even imagine how that would happen -- I actually tried to make it slip after hours of operation (some said the computer got too hot for the rubber which led to slippage) and I can tell you that scenario is extremely improbable. My computer is always locked firmly into place on this stand, regardless of how long or how hot the computer gets during operation. Just clean the rubber bars once every few months (as you should anyway) and all will be fine."
9,"I was a little concerned when I received and unpacked this machine. There was a strange noise, like tumbling broken glass, whenever I moved it. I didn't see anything broken, so continued to set it up and put it to use. The machine is very quiet in operation. I haven't tried it with 16 sheets, and it does run paper through more slowly than our last machine. The ""Bin full' warning is a nice feature. The machine stops, ""bin full"" signal flashes, it beeps, and then spits back out the paper it was working on. Time to pull out the bin, empty it, and then continue shredding. I put it through quite a test, getting rid of a box of papers I had set aside to shred, and never had a problem with it overheating or getting jammed."
10,"I really love this grocery cart. It is exactly what I needed. I can haul heavy laundry, groceries and take out heavy trash bags from my apartment. It is just what I needed."
11,This is a neat and extremely handy little labeling system. There is a lot that can be done with it all you need is a little bit of imagination!
12,"I was a front desk supervisor at a hotel. I also used to order office supplies for that department. We went through 5 different sets of staplers in 2 years. I finally hit upon this stapler. I loved this product. When I left, one of my going away presents was my ""Moby 1"" stapler (we named them at work). I have it at my new job and it is now 10 years old and everyone at my new work uses it. Still goest through 50 pages. Great product."
13,"I have been using these notebooks since 1992. They last forever, can always be accessed and never need a driver or a cable..."
14,"I tried about a dozen office staplers at a local office supply store and this one was, by far, the most rigid laterally and the best built. It is the only one I've found that has a alignment guide built into the base casting that assures that the moving arm can't get out of alignment with the ""saddle"" which bends the staples. Will easily handle 25 sheets of 24 lb bond paper. Its rubber padded shape is dramatically more comfortable than the usual, sharp-cornered designs such as Bostich. It has a soft, non-slip base and is fairly heavy, so stays in place. The lifetime guarantee is frosting on the cake.It will staple to 8cm from the paper's edge which is less than some other staplers, but should be enough for most uses. Its deep metallic blue color is actually much darker that it appears in the Amazon photo. In dim light it looks black."
15,This is a great pen! Sexy design if your into stainless steel. Solid construction and easy writing. Point size makes it perfect if your always filling out forms that ask for a lot of info in a small field!
16,"I bought these to replace the paper and plastic bubble mailers I got at SAMS. I get a whole lot more mailers for my money and they are perfect for my needs - the various sizes are a boon as well. Very Satisfied with the fast delivery, too."
17,"I'm surprised to see the handful of negative reviews from other customers on this machine, and can only assume that the problems they've encountered are due to their own impatience and refusal to read the book to see how it works. I've had mine for close to 3 years and have recommended it to other home-business owners, as well.WHAT I LIKE: speed dial is a cinch; multi-tasks as phone, fax, answering machine, and last-resort copier; answering machine is digital (no distorted tapes) and functions remotely (check your messages from anywhere); prints on plain paper (not those nasty, curly thermal rolls); offers different graphics settings for fax (photos, light/dark, etc.); &quot;hold&quot; button is useful for phone calls; if image toner roll runs out mid-fax or while you're out, messages and faxes are autoatically stored in memory; automatically detects incoming phone calls vs. faxes on TAD setting -- no need to be there to switch the machine over; identifies and receives 99% of incoming faxes, no matter what machine the sender is using.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: while the toner rolls are inexpensive and easy to find at office supply stores, they don't last more than a few months with heavy useage; the &quot;speaker&quot; setting is for outgoing calls only until call is answered -- not a real speakerphone; a blinking light would be easier to see than the blinking LED display to show new messages; remote functions are thorough but require exhaustive list of codes, like *3 and *33 and *5 and *# -- too complicated to bother; I personally use the &quot;copier&quot; function only when my other machine is down, because the quality looks like a fax and because it uses up the image toner roll.Overall, like I said, if you are willing to spend 10 minutes with an instruction manual for initial setup -- which I hope you would be to properly learn your machine -- then it's a great fax with tons of useful features. No one will ever know you saved so much money on it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
18,"So far, I've had pretty good results with this product and my Kodak dock. I just wish could do bigger picturs on it! The maximum size with the printer dock is 4x6."
19,"I love these cards for at home printing. They are a nice quality stock and so far my printer has printed some great images. I'm a graphic designer and photographer by trade, so I'm pretty critical of how things print out and look on paper. These are definitely a great and economic solution to making personalized cards."
20,Bought this and it turned out really good. Was a lot of functionality at really cool price. The reading aloud feature also worked well for the dictionary.
21,"My favorite comics are ""Calvin and Hobbes,"" ""Bloom County,"" ""Dilbert"" and ""Mutts."" Anyone familiar with those strips would know that my giving ""Get Fuzzy"" 5 stars & equating it with those strips is high praise indeed. I didn't immediately like ""Get Fuzzy"" when I first started reading it. It has grown on me. This strip is BETTER in book form than it is in the newspaper. It reads better in book form. It grows on the reader. I love how the strips are cumulative. I love that Conley tells stories through a series of strips. I love how he returns to themes. I love how something will come up in passing in one strip and then get expanded in another strip much later. I love the consistency of the characters. And I love the way this strip is drawn. I hope it runs for a long, long time & the quality holds up. This collection is one to read and re-read. I don't laugh out loud much, but I sustain a strong smile for most of the book."
22,"This is a great size for a holiday letter card where you can print a photo on the cover and your letter on the inside, works easier if your printer does doublesided automatically."
23,"Looked at a number of different card holders, but I love the feel of leather. Finally, a replacement for my plastic holder that I had used for years (and was finally getting a little ragged). Store my business cards one side, and medical stuff in the other side, carry it with me wherever I go. Really well designed and constructed."
24,I am a purchasing agent that buys for 8 entities. this is a good machine at a resonable price for a medium size company.
25,Thin but strong and very usable. What I needed for organizing my kids' drawings/artwork on loose paper. Love that it's acid free. I just bought 4th package-I had a lot to organize.
26,"being a collector of old phones this one fits right in so i can pick up my messages with the push buttons. heavy enough to give that real feeling with a great ring. so far, i'm very please with it."
27,I bought this as a xmass gift for my wife and she just loves it. She works from home a lot and is on business calls often. It has great sound quality and is so small and light it is great to carry around because it is not bulky. There are a ton of features but she does not use them often. She just loves to have her hands free and is able to get other stuff done when she is on the phone. This is a must have for any person who is on the phone often. A great product!
28,"The assembly was a bit difficult. The directions were not very clear. The product seems to be a good value, however."
29,"makes a good gift, liked by the people I gave them to. I would recommend this to anyone as a neat gift."
30,Sure beats the individual cost at office supply stores when purchased in volume.Nice transaction
31,"Really do love this purchase. Like another reviewer noted, though, the design is not exactly the same as pictured both here and on their actual website. I can tell the designs are SUPPOSED to appear the same, but there are lines and dots in the border design not shown in the image, and the actual design in the center is much darker and a bit smaller than pictured.I also have another Ecollo World Traveler book which is described as 6x8 that I purchased at Staples that is supposed to be the same size as this one. In comparison, side by side, the Staples book is smaller than this book.It is worth noting that if this is really handmade, then the discrepancies are likely because the book is unique. It's still a very nice purchase, and much cheaper than where you'd normally find it. I have been afraid to write in it because it is quite a beautiful book regardless of the differences between the pictures and the actual product. I guess the differences just worried me at first because I questioned whether or not the purchase was authentic; after owning it for a while, though, I'm happy enough with the beauty and quality of the book that I am not so concerned about it anymore."
32,"I had one just like this that I had purchased 12 years ago. It had lasted so long I decided I would look for another one just like it. The only reason I had to get a new one was because my neice had decided to copy her hand and broke off a piece of plastic. Otherwise, it was still going strong."
33,"This looks great on my desk when paired with matching items - desk tray, pencil holder. The best reason to get this is to always have post-its handy. You can fill this with several packs at once. This keeps them from getting lost on a busy desk."
34,"This product is great. It gives a spell checker, dichanary, and thusoruse. My homework is over way quicker than when I used my coumputer's spell checker. The games are great to. The timer has come in handy to. I truly recomend it."
35,"I've tried another brands of signature capture pad, but this device was so easy to use that the first time i install it i though that i was missing something, but i wasn't.I have my own software company and i recommend this ePad for everyone that need a very easy, helpfully and hi-tech solution device."
36,I purchased this product so I could make my own address labels. It is so simple to use and quick to load into the printer and select the type of label.
37,this item is totally professional and gives excellent resultswould hope that it continues to be available as can not find it in our stores
38,"My HP49g stopped working after ten years due to rust inside on steel parts. A cheap-ass build but it performed.My new HP35s is nearly all the 49g was but the keyboard is laid out a little different. I'm relearning. This 35g is a slim compact design, very attractive appearance, key nomenclature is easy to read making it easy to find the functions. The read out is smaller than i'm used to, it shows two lines of the stack and is easy to see. Good enough!A teriffic feature it has is that it can be set to algebraic mode for those who don't like or use RPN. If you're used to the way most calculators operate or don't know how to work with RPN but want a super calculator like this, then this is the one to buy. Cost was low for what you get as far as functionality.All in all, I'm completely satisfied with the HP35s, it does all I need and more from complex engineering calculations to just adding 2+2. It also comes with a nice protective case that is soft and flexible and protects the calculator in your pocket or if it's dropped. One of HP's finest. I've used HP's since 1977 and this is the best one so far. No need to spend more for any other calculator. I'm sold on this one! Thanks, Amazon, for the good price.Walt"
39,"I recently bought this phone, and it has performed very well. Yes, the keys are a little ""soft"", and you have to be sure to press them down firmly, but that's a minor inconvenience when you factor in the good speaker phone quality (for the other caller and for you), the ease of setting up the phone, the clear functions, etc. One note of caution: I had bought this same phone last year, and it was doing very well until I inadvertently pulled out the longer hand-set cord I had installed--the phone went ballistic, gave a constant busy signal, and was unusable, so I had to ditch it. I would advise sticking with the shorter cord the phone comes with, if you don't have to move around the room a long distance from the base unit. It's a fine phone so far (about 1 1/2 months since purchase)."
40,This item is great and easy to use. Love it; very good quality in this type of products. Will definitely buy from this manufacturer again. Highly recommended.
41,"I've had this phone for about two weeks now, and so far, I love it. I've had cordless phones in the past with lots of extras like dual keypads and speaker-phones and I never used these features. I don't use caller ID and I have a perfectly good answering machine. All I wanted was a good quality cordless phone that couldn't be easily over heard by neighbors baby monitors. I got just that. This phone has incredible range, excelent sound quality, and great battery life. The DSS gives us peace of mind for security too. The only fault I can find with this phone is the speaker hole for listening. It's very small and is located high up on the handset. Beacause of this, it's easy to let the phone &quot;ride up&quot; while you're talking and it sounds as if the volume is dropping off. Just pay attention to how you hold this phone and you'll be very happy with it!"
42,"This calculator is for those who believe 'only the best is good enough'. It is stylish because of its original design, its classic, it is solid and feels good in your hands. I bought it recently and I love it. recomended for those who think diffrent! ;)"
43,"Netgear Dual Mode Cordless Phone with Skypeyou hardly need the excellent documentation to easily install and use this voip. the GUI screen is intuitive although somewhat slow and cumbersome. after entering your user id & password, netgear automatically retrieves your skype info from the internet..., including contacts, credit balances, etc. As advertised, one never has to turn on their computer for the netgear to function smoothly with skype. . RF does NOT seem to interfere with other RF & bluetooth devices. Cordless reception is pretty good, but degrades beyond 20 +/- feet from the wireless base. The few surprises have more to do with Skype than the netgear hardware. 1) When you place outbound calls, Skype does NOT identify you with a proper caller ID.. Sometimes your outbound call appears as strange set of numbers, or sometimes your user ID. Friends with landlines (no skype) may not answer incoming calls from such strange IDs. 2). My skepein voicemail never worked properly after I installed the netgear. Voicemail was always busy. Skype never responded to my requests for customer service to fix voicemail. rather than pay extra for skype in and a defective voicemail system, I recommend GrandCentral: free voicemail, local unique phone number assigned, plus other excellent services. I only need skype for the occasional outbound calls anyway. 3) The only real negative to the NETGEAR product, per se, : after you place an outbound call, the dial paid stops functioning. this becomes a problem if you need to identify yourself with an extra imput of, say, your credit card number when speaking to your bank. In those rare instances, I simply got online with my MAC, dialed from Skype and used the computer software for dialing extra digits. Since I dropped MA Bell's landland, I can't personally vouch for Netgear's dual function capability (however, everything else about netgear worked as advertised). Finally, remember there is NO 911 service with skype. My cell phone covers that critical function."
44,"I like this printer and is my only printer that I have. It works great, it prints great, and works without any problems. Sure it has had a paper jam here and there but that happens to all printers. Another reason why I love it is my room started to flood and the printer was soaked before I could remove it and start taking out the water. Dried it off, took out the wet paper and made sure no water was inside and plugged it in again and it STILL WORKS! Its old but man, if it can survive that then it is a true winner in my book."
45,"None will match the 48GX yet we see some similarities. It has the same feel and accepted for the PE exam. Good calculator, will allow for speed calculations."
46,"Ordered, sent, and received with lightning fast speed! Cable and disc included, and not a single scratch on the screen or case. Thanks!"
47,"This product is a good one for the beginning Spanish learner --- once you figure it out! The directions that come with the device are terrible, and the operation was not intuitive for me. However, once you know what to do, it is easy and works the way we all want it to. I called Franklin directly to find out the proper procedure.* This device will SPEAK the word that is HIGHLIGHTED on the screen *1. Type the word you want to learn in the language you know.2. Hit ""Enter"".3. Wait for the translation to appear on screen.4. Hit ""Enter"" again. This will highlight the word you typed.5. Now, use the arrow button to MOVE THE HIGHLIGHTING down to the translated word.6. Once the translation is highlighted, hit ""Speak"" and it will say the word out loud for you with proper pronunciation!I hope this helps."
48,"As a professional photographer, sometimes I have need to print on site photos. I have an HP portable printer and use only the Advanced paper in it. With the Vivera ink and the Advanced paper, prints come out dry and appear to be printed below the surface, unlike most papers where you can see the outline if you look across the plane of the sheet. It looks like traditional photographic printing and that's what is important to me."
49,"it's a ok phone for the price. clear sound, easy to operate, and it's so cheap."
50,"Needing a roll about stool to rest my legs and back when preparing salads and other fare for my 80 yr. old wife and me, I regretfully chose this item. It's one of the worst decisions I've ever made. It's poorly constructed with wobbly legs; the only swiveling occurs at the sometimes slow swiveling three casters. The saddle would wear out an elephant's posterior. It's easy enough to turn it over when going backwards but don't even think of going forwards across your kitchen unless you love hitting the floor. I returned mine to the assistive device company from whom I purchased it (not PPR). The authority of my assessment is forty years as a physical therapist. My advice: try an adjustable drafting stool."
51,"These are basically stackable cardboard (reinforced) storage boxes They are strong and well made, work pretty well, and get the job done. However, I think the price is *very* expensive for what you get. I use them in a walk-in closet and they work ok for that purpose."
52,"Seller just phoned me at work and wanted me to remove the negative feedback I'd left three days before. I told her it's the truth and will not be removed:""Lasted two days before breaking. (wouldn't turn on or do anything) We shipped it back and finally received a replacement. It's working so far.""I think seller is very unprofessional to do this and will be filing a complaint with Amazon for the harrassment at work.Dave C."
53,Ordered this desk tray because of the picture and description. I was looking for a dark stained oak to match my desk. What arrived didn't look anything like the picture. It was unstained oak with a poly coating. Very light in color. Item was labeled as the correct part number.
54,"This is 2nd, diff item purchased in this category. Not too happy w/operation as it doesn't want to hold info - needs to be reset even more than other one I bought!"
55,"This is a terrible product. I carefully followed the directions in applying the transfers. Some of the edges didn't look all that great, so I decided to cover the edges with sewn on trim. Wish now I hadn't bothered. Washed the (100% organic cotton) tees in cold water, turned inside out. My plan was to hang the tees up to dry, but they came out of the washer (used delicate cycle) all cracked and generally awful. Definitely ruined some tees."
56,"I have been a LONG time religious purchaser of SONY phones and stereo components, and I'm sorry to say that I will no longer purchase SONY phones. This phone has given me continous problems since week 3. The signal kicks out, even in the same room as the base set, you can hear it changing channels (and it cuts off reception while doing so). I returned it twice and had the same problems with the new phones. I just replaced it with the Siemen's 2.4gig. All in all, you can get MUCH better phones for the money. NOTE** My Sony 900MHz from 3 years ago is still running strong, but these new ones are just horrible."
57,"If you're gonna buy a graphing calc, get a TI-89, I first bought this Casio one and it's completely overrated by the most part of the people that has written here... It's not good at all.Now I'm totally satisfied with my TI-89"
58,"I'm not very picky with paper, as long as it's nice quality but Mead is no exception. Although Mead sells quality products, their looseleaf papers have always been a problem for me. The problem is that they have such a bad, cheap smell and the quality of the paper is very close to what I will find at a 99 cents store, minus the sandy texture. I've been buying Staples paper for as long as I can remember and I find that their quality is so much nicer (and cheaper!). I don't think I'll even spend more than $1 on Mead looseleaf, let alone $4."
59,This dictionary is exceptionally hard to use. Thank goodness for smart phone dictionaries. this phone makes not sense to use. It was even difficult to use if I followed the instructions. On top of that it was slow.
60,"Bought this phone when I signed up for Vonage less than a year ago. In 9 months, this phone has died twice unexpectedly. The first time it died, I could not receive calls or dial out. Trying to replace it through Vonage customer service was a joke. After at least 6 hours of hold times, and repeatedly explaining the problem they finally sent me a new one. I was without my phone for a whole month (completely unacceptable for running a business) and had to pay the shipping for the replacement phone. Thanks Vonage! Just four months later, the second phone has now completely died. Once again, Vonage customer service has proved to be no help. I took matters into my own hands and bought a Vonage/Linksys router with a regular phone. Everything works fine now so far. Fingers crossed."
61,"I love the height this riser gives my laptop. But it's been a real pain to put together. I finally figured out where all the parts are supposed to go, but still haven't managed to make it secure. It currently is in danger of tilting and sliding my laptop onto the table, because I can't get some of the parts to click together right. Maybe there's a magic formula I'm missing. The paper instructions didn't help at all."
62,"Wow these phones look great. Not to mention terrific ringer customization, sharp Caller ID LCD + call memory, and freedom from phone jacks make this combo a dream come true. Seemingly a steal for under $50.The bad, however, strongly outweighs the good with the 25931EE2. The phones have a tendency to become 'unpaired' with their core (tethered) base; just hope you can find the second unit if/when the 'UNAVAILABLE' message of death appears on the Caller ID when receiving a call.Related, peer reviewers are very accurate in their criticisms of the whisper low listening volume on these phones; approximately 1/3 of received calls are very difficult to hear even on the highest volume level. Odd since the ringers can scare the bejeebuz out of you in sheer volume.Finally, numbers tend to dial...but no dialtone emerges. Or vice versa. Unless you have a longing desire to have random conversations with strangers due to eclectic dialing, the 25931EE2 might not be for you.The alternatives, however, are very costly -- almost 2-3x the price. This may simply be one of those technologies where a brief wait is well worth the merger between price and features."
63,"The content is not bad for this add-on card, but there are a lot of better alternatives out there. My favorite is Qvadis Lexica, for example, which has available translation options between English and Spanish, French, German, Italian and Portuguese. The Qvadis user interface is superior, and you can add your own words and edit definitions on the go. It is software, not an SD card, but a better buy, in my opinion. This is the kind of program Palm should have included in this PalmPak card."
64,"Problem being, I use my stapler about 50 times a day. After a while, these jam up and can be quite annoying. If you use your stapler infrequently, this is a fine unit. It you use yours often, I'd recommend a higher end stapler like the 747."
65,"I bought this phone to replace the older PC dependent VOIP321 because I kept getting dropped calls, which I suspected was due to my slower computer. Now with this PC less phone, I consistently have dropped Skype calls after a few minutes, regardless of it being a Skype to Skype, SkypeOut or SkypeIn call. I am already planning to return it."
66,"I was expecting something sturdier for how much it cost. At $30, I feel ripped off. It's cheap plastic and adjusting it is challenging for fear of breaking the legs.Thinking of putting a laptop on it? It's so deep that their little &#34;stick-em non-slip stickers&#34; will only touch one end of your laptop. Poor design!I do not recommend this product!"
67,"I bought a Zebra F-301 ball pen in Hong Kong and I loved to use it! But when I went back to the States, I used it up so I wanted to buy some refill. Compared to the original pen, the refill I bought could not write smoothly as the ink was dry. Disappointed with the purchase :("
68,i would not buy this phone for the price it is not worth it
69,I loved it for the year or so it lasted but now I have a $40 laser pointer. :(
70,"This was a huge disappointment! Chintzy! The box that it was packed in was more substantial than the assembled unit. The plastic channels (to slide over the partitions) did not slide at all. For the price, very sub-standard product."
71,"There is no contouring to this phone at all, and the handset is WAY too small and totally flat. I can never have a decent conversation on this phone because when the earpiece is on my ear, the mouthpiece is 2-3 inches away from my mouth.Also, when I speak, my own voice tends to drown out the person I am talking with.To top it off, the answering machine always blinks, whether there are messages or not. I have to wonder what they were possibly thinking when they designed such a poor phone. If this were a cell phone I might be a little more forgiving of the handset, but since it is a full sized phone and a rather expensive one I expected much, much better.As it stands, I am considering buying another phone altogether, this one is so poorly designed."
72,"We've had this phone for about a year and haven't been thrilled. The most disappointing is the answering machine. The outgoing message is not very clear and the incoming are scratchy and not clear either. Just this last week it finally kicked the bucket. I thought it was just the battery but we've replaced it and it still is not working. I'm searching for a replacement now, won't be buying another one of these though."
73,"My biggest disappointment with this phone is that you cannot take it outside of the house. I live in a very small house and as soon as I step outside with this phone, it is unable to locate the base. Waste of money."
74,"My rating is for Hewlett Packard.Although HP wants you to buy the HP 27 replacement cartridge, the 5610 also accepts the older 56 black cartridge. The 56 contains 19ml of black ink @$20.(on sale at Target occasionally $15) The 'recommended' 27 has 10ml @$18. No wonder buyers are running out of ink so fast.HP customer service said 27 has 'improved' technology. Sorry. Black is black."
75,Bought because we loved the features. Soon found out that the features were overstated. Jammed so often that we stopped shredding anything but regular sheets of paper; less than seven. Lasted well under a year. Was able to clean out the last jam but it would only work for a few seconds in reverse. Disappointed especially for the price. Love the wastebasket which I am still using in my office. The most expensive wire wastebasket I will ever buy I am sure. My advice is listen to the reviews. There are more reliable shredders on the market. Don't risk your money or time on this one because it will just drive you nuts.
76,"We've had this timeclock for about 4 years. We're happy with the overall functionality of it, however... the most important part of the timeclock is having it PRINT onto a timecard. After a year or two, the printing got lighter & lighter, even after experimenting with various ribbons & replacing them all too often. I called the company recently about this problem, & they walked me through how to clean the printhead. I did that several times, but it has not helped... parts of the numbers are not visible when printed. So... I would not recommend this time clock. I am now shopping for a new one, & am thinking I will just stay away from anything made by Pyramid."
77,"On the packing it says ""This KODAK Paper can be used in any conusumer inkjet printer"". True! It doesn't say it will produce good results. The output is dark and bluish on my HP printer. It looks dirty and dull! Maybe there is some printer out there it suits! Not recommended!"
78,"The description states that it can be used for a flat screen, and it is not suited for that purpose. When I actually received the box it was clear from the instruction set it is meant for a full-size monitor and to be attached along the flat side of a large monitor with an adhesive strip. There is no clamp as shown in the photo. Although I did attempt to mount it to my flat screen monitor, as pictured on the front of the box (but the instructions inside are for a large monitor), it is not suitable for that purpose because the arm is so short that the viewing plane has to be tilted away from the screen, which defeats the purpose of having it there to review documents. The description and the picture are not accurate. Now I have this copyholder pasted to my monitor and it is essentially useless."
79,"Despite the poor reviews, I went ahead and ordered this product assuming it was a one time manufacturing glitch resulting in a bad batch. That does not appear to be the case unless Amazon has failed to take notice and work with Scotch on securing a replacement quantity. The tape I just received was so bad it failed to even stick to itself. I would avoid this item until there definitive evidence the problem has been fixed."
80,This phone did not work well at all. It was cheaply constructed and only lasted about 2 hours out of the box.
81,"I bought this to use in teaching at the university. I installed the software and found that the device didn't work. I called technical service at Seiko but apparently this item was discontinued several years ago. A nice gentleman attempted to help me but it was clear that he had never seen or setup or used the device. I was on the line with him quite a while and apparently his supervisor felt enough was enough so I was told to try something and call back if I had problems. I was disgusted with Seiko and contacted my seller and requested a refund. He was very nice about it, credited me that day, and didn't even want the device back.Bottom-line: don't waste your money - Seiko gave up on it ages ago and they don't support it."
82,"I have an old top of the line Swingline stapler that does an excellent job of stapling as many as 20 sheets of paper together. When my wife needed a new stapler, I went to Amazon and ordered the top of the line Swingline stapler similar to the one I had. It did such a lousy job of stapling that I had to return it for a replacement. The replacement is a little better, but still not as good as my old stapler. In my old stapler, the plate that forms the staple is completely recessed into the base where it is held solidly in place. On the new stapler, the plate is only party recessed into the base. Swingline obviously saved a few cents by cheapening its product without regard for its performance. A price that we customers have to pay more and more every day as quality is sacrificed on the altar of the almighty dollar."
83,"I love RPN calculators. Saw this one and was thrilled to see an RPN calculator that did NOT have the graphing capability. Not everyone needs a calculator for the SATs; some of us work for a living. After a month the '8' key started sticking. Another friend of mine is on his 2nd calculator because of key pad issues. The '+' died on his. He is now looking at a Casios becasue the HP customer service support blew him off when he asked for 3rd calculator. I'm still using mine, but once the '8' finally dies I'm looking elsewhere.The following is an online petition to get the 15C back into production. These old HP calculators are going for $150-400 on ebay. Unreal!http://hp15c.org:8080/"
84,I found out that the calculator produces wrong Interest Rate Payment calculation results. There must be a bug in the calculator's formula chip. The calculated results wouldn't even match the ones in the manual that came with the calculator.I would stir clear of this model and go for a different model.
85,"This phone is a waste of money. It works fine while it is still under warranty - 90 days, but after that it has a short and you cannot receive incoming calls, place outgoing calls, caller ID does not work, but the phone still rings. Not to mention draining 4 AA batteries in one week. This was by far the worst purchase made on-line."
86,"I should say that I did not try this phone with skype, but there were several disappointments with it as a regular phone.1.) It uses AAA batteries and does not come with, or appear to have any option for a transformer (wall wart), so you have to watch the batteries and replace them. No batteries are included. Maybe using it USB provides phantom power? If so, what happens when you turn your computer off?2.) The speaker-phone cuts off the first word of everything you say, making it unusable.3.) The display is hard to read at some angles.Everything else about it seems great, but we are returning it for the above reasons."
87,"Once again another large corporation has opted to ignore almost 20% of potential customers by ignoring the ability of this phone to interfere with an Apple Computer.If the company thinks so little of 20% of potential customers, how do you think it feels about the other 80%??"
88,"The clear packing tape gets stuck on the metal guide each time I try to use it. Most dispensers of this type have a flexible or hinged guide, this one is unmoveable and evidently welds itslef to packing tape. It's useless."
89,"Poor solar cell function, hardly see the entered numbers inside the classroom probaly due to poor solar cells, I rather buy cheap non branded Scientific calculator waste of my money"
90,"I would not be surprised if D-Link even attempted to get their drivers certified, which they are not... with Windows Vista: the system crashes randomly while this is running - Windows 7: plugging the device into the computer produces a system crash every time.Run away... yea, it is cheap, but it's not even worth a try."
91,"Good features on this phone system, the speaker phone is really great. However, the buttons on the handsets stop working after 12-14 months making the phone unusuable. We have had this happen on 2/3 handsets. This phone is going in the trash, I'm replacing with a Panasonic."
92,"I like how the phone functions, it was working lovely... I had this phone for half year and problems begun. It often lose signal when I'm not even that far from the base phone. The phone just dies on me time to time, I get cut off right in middle of my calls. I ended up connecting my old 900MHz phone to a phone splitter, so that I can at least use this panasonic phone as caller ID box... What is wrong with this picture?"
93,"Just purchased the Sharp XE A404. The promos and even a pre-purchase call to Sharp Customer Service all misled me to believe that it could be used with our Quickbooks. We have QuickBooks Pro 2008 and the cash register cannot communicate with our computer.It only works with QB 2006 and OLDER. Also, new larger storage SD cards will not work as they don't have SMALL enough memory. It only works with a 128Mb or 512MB. The sole reason we wanted this machine was its supposed compatibility with QuickBooks. The customer service person was either mis-informed or lying. It looks nice and is quiet. The manual is poorly organized and does not detail enough information. The software for the computer interface is merely an infantile spread sheet. Forget about customized ""Logo"" interfacing/creating from your computer to the cash register. This is a stand alone unit...and not that great. Oh..I've been in retail for 30 years."
94,"The garbage cans are great but come with no lid, the lids they advertise (an additional $9.00) were way too small. Therefore went looking for the lids at the local Home Depot and found the the entire thing for less money and with it appropriate lid. When trying to return it, I have to pay for the shipping back and a 15% re-stocking fee. Not happy."
95,"I bought this phone about 8 months ago after a thunderstorm killed my Uniden. Given the similarity of the menu options, I suspect the AT&T; and Uniden models are actually made by the same OEM.First, a rant: this phone (and the Uniden before it) has a ""remote access"" mode whereby you can control the answering machine remotely (listen to/delete messages, change greetings, etc). This mode is protected by a very weak 2-digit numeric code. First, it's unforgiveable to use such a weak code. Secondly, there doesn't appear to be a way to disable remote access! Bad.Anyway, At 8 months, the phone is showing signs of failure. Beginning last week, the phone has stopped receiving callerid information. It merely displays ***RINGING***. Similarly, the call activity LED on the AT&T; base console no longer flashes when a call has been received. Looking at some of the other reviews, it seems that my problems are not unique.I think I paid $50 for this phone but whatever it was, it was too much given that it has lasted less than a year. For comparison, my other phone is a $7 no-name Wal*Mart special (it too has callerid and call activity LED). It has yet to miss a beat.My recommendation to potential buyers is to keep looking."
96,"Very cheap phone, horriable reception, poor quality. Worst AT&T phone ever"
97,"I ordered these to use as Thank You cards, and they look incredibly cheap. They look just as if I would have put them together by myself at home, using my home printer to print them on regular paper. Not worth the price, not worth any price, unless it is less than what it would cost you to print them up yourself.Thankfully I also ordered another set, the 'Black and Cream Thank You Cards' from Peter Pauper Press, which cost half as much, and looks more than twice as nice."
98,I bought this shredder and another model at the same time. This one is just not measuring up. It jams all the time and just doesn't work as well as I think it should!
99,Ordered the satin HP paper. Price was great and it shipped on time. Paper does not lay flat after printing and you have to be VERY careful that you do not get fingerprints on the paper before printing. It smudges after printing and sometimes has little random spots where the ink does not stay. I will stick with just plain glossy photo paper from now on.
