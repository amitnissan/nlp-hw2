0,nice set and i really liked how clear they are since i had one before that had measurements and marks on it so i needed a clear one,True
1,"My 4th grader uses this to help with spelling/word meanings. Promotes independence. I don't hear ""Mom, how do you spell.....etc...."" as much! Great for prewriting/writing.",True
2,"Hey, If you could find a man that was all in one, wouldn't you want him too.",True
3,"i use this photo paper with my PhotoSmart HP P1100 - and the results are excellent. i rarely print 8x10 prints, but still use this paper to print multiple images (various sizes) on one page. then i trim the photos. overall, the cost is cheaper for me normally than printing on 4x6 paper. perhaps it sounds like tedious to trim the photos, but i use a Fiskars 12-inch paper trimmer and the results are professional-looking borderless prints with little effort. i include small-sized photos printed on this paper inside greeting cards that i send to family/friends. They make nice surprises. There is a Matte-finish version of this paper also. Search for C6950A. And for 4x6 sized paper, look for C6944A. this paper is certainly the best for glossy output using an HP printer. The results are stunning. Instant gratification for your investment in digital imaging. (For great greeting card paper, look for C6044A.)",True
4,"Well made. Functional. Excellent organizer for all types of business cards, credit cards, travel cards, etc. Eveything in one place.",True
5,this pen is great i use it for school it is small and easy to carry around and i wright under water jest for fun and if you dont push on the paper it will work!!!the ink is smooth it is not scratchy a great pen again.,True
6,Purchased this unit for a client as an upgrade to their existing stand. Easy installation and functionality. I would highly recommended this unit.,True
7,"So this came as a freebie when I purchased the Canon Pixma 900 recently and in the few prints I have completed at this size so far has produced excellent quality.When combined with Prime shipping it was a simple no brainer...after all if you aren't satisfied returns are a breeze.Thankfully I have rarely had to exercise that choice but when I have it has been painless....how to regular stores stay ni business these days when I can sit here and order what I want, have it in my hands 2 days later? No brainer!",True
8,"This is a good product, and has also been recommended to me by someone else who had one, he tried other brands of the same product and had constant problems with them. Brother puts out very good products, it is not the first Brother product I have had. You can trust the Brother name on a printer, fax, etc. Laurie Dughi",True
9,"I love this stapler so much I bought four of them (through an online store deal). One for home, work, and to give to my mother and to a friend.It staples two pieces or a stack of paper with almost no effort. Takes standard staples and it's portable.",True
10,"The convenience of this journal's size makes it a constant companion for me. There's no need to leave it behind because it won't fit in the purse of the day!It's small enough to be unobtrusive, but big enough for me to record my thoughts and illustrate them with the requisite illustrations.The heart is a just another reason to love it all the more!",True
11,"Even though the S&H; was a little on the high side, the overall cost was still below the cost at Staples or some other office supply store by a couple of dollars.[...]",True
12,"Elegant ballpoint pen, manufactured to high standards. Handles well; writes well using supplied Pelikan ballpoint cartridge/refill or Schmidt EasyFlow 9000 refill (both are standard Parker-design refills). This supplier provided the best price and delivered quickly.",True
13,"These are much sturdier than the manila folders and hanging file folders I have in my home office. These are made with heavier covers and a reinforced spine. The dividers are made from recycled cardboard and are lighter in weight.The product description does a great job of describing the features of these folders.I plan to use them for getting my records organized for my piano students and I'll be able to keep a file of the different quizzes and activities I have them do. The one drawback to this system is that I have to punch holes in the top of the pages and it isn't as easy to remove pages or move them around. However, that's also a plus because papers will stay put if I drop the file.Any business that uses these regularly will find the durability and expandability (up to 2 inches) a great asset to a filing system. It's also a great tool for organizing a project that has multiple phases or categories.",True
14,"Very elegant pen, smooth as silk. Great weight and feel in your hand. This is the best pen I own.",True
15,"As with all Avery labels I have tried, these work very well. They print go through the printer without jamming, print cleanly, peel easily, and stick tightly.What more could you want? Highly recommended.",True
16,"I have been using this pen at work for about a week and I absolutely love it. The nib is very smooth considering the pen's price, and the pen feels very comfortable thanks to the angled sides on the grip. I usually use a micro point gel pen, and I like this better even though it has a medium nib. The writing looks substantial and I can write in fairly small script legibly. The ink flows very well, I have not experienced any skipping or fading. I like the color of the blue ink that came with the pen and plan to buy these refills for the color alone. This pen has exceeded my expectations in every way.",True
17,"This replaced a previous unit that was water damaged. This unit was easy to add to our existing system. The updated back lighting and key buttons being larger and color coded makes this even better than our previous model. Looking to replace the remaining units with this model, and only because it seems the previous ones, even with new batteries, are no longer holding the charge. But after 8 years, maybe that's to be expected. Our experience with Uniden has been so great, it is the only home phone product we consider.",True
18,"I had one of these phones that I bought two years ago. No troubles with it at all, and it has out lived most of the other cordlesses we've owned. Then we got a really big puppy. Need I say more? I needed a new handset, but unfortunately, this phone was discontinued. I was so delighted to find it from this supplier! When it arrived and I unpacked it, to my dismay it did not have the number buttons on the desk unit. I phoned the supplier to send it back, but he offered me a credit and we've combined phones and made it work. All happy.",True
19,"I have used this notebook model 43-571 made by National for the past 30 years and would not use any other. The pages are bound like a hard cover book, pages are numbered, easy readable green tint, cover is a hard press board that never wears out with a tape bound edge.If you want a notebook that will not wear out this is it, and I have had no problem in being able to locate and buy this notebook. I also use a laptop, and blackberry but prefer to keep a written backup of my notes. Once you fill one of these up you just put it away and you always have it. Never crashes, catches a virus or locks you out!Please buy them so National will continue to make them for the next 30 years.",True
20,"A couple of years ago I found the Zebra G-301 Stainless Steel pen. This is a gel pen that provides smooth and effortless writing. I love this pen and everyone that borrows it tries to keep it. The down side is that the ink capacity is small and, until recently, they did not offer the refills separately. Now refills are available but only in two packs. I bought ten 2packs of refill to make sure I do not run out. Hopefully, by the time I use these up they will be offering bulk packs of refills.",True
21,"The Bic Mark-Its are great quality permanent markers. I first tested one on a an aluminum soda can. The lines and letters I drew were clean and crisp. The ink dried in about 2 seconds. When I ran it under water it held fast. When I washed the can with hand soap, the ink still held fast.The colors are over the top. I mainly use black. However, the different colors fit nicely into my office file classification scheme. Different color dots denote different categories of files and various important dates associated with those files. I've been able to be more precise in my classifications by using additional colors.Another plus is the acid free ink. I don't like to use ink that can damage important papers. I would feel very comfortable using these markers on anything because of the acid free promise. My wife uses them on her scrapbooks. She is very picky about the ink she uses because it has to be acid free, colorful, smudge proof, and can't easily soak through paper. These BIC Mark-Its are a hit with her because they more than meet her needs.",True
22,"The handle is what convinced me to purchase this dayplanner. I looked at what is available in the 2"" rings (which isn't much by the way) and even though I would have preferred the burgandy color (sold out)this ended up being nicer than I would have thought. It easily held all my pages, and the miscellaneous that always crops up, but the best part is being able to carry it without it in my briefcase. Highly recommend this to anyone whose life needs EXTRA organization!",True
23,"I have been using this tablet for about a month.The tablet itself is well constructed. Metal on the back, plastic on the front. It is quite thin. The drawing surface can be lifted in order to insert an image underneath it. The drawing area is a full 6""x8"", with additional space around that used for shortcut buttons.The pen is decent. It works well, has two buttons on the barrel, but no eraser. No biggie. The pressure sensitivity works very well, with a full 1024 levels. Its operation is smooth and glitchless.The mouse is rather small and doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it works without problems.The drivers are surprisingly good. There are options to redefine what the pen buttons do (however, this can only be set to do standard mouse operations, such as left click, right click, double clicks, etc.); you can clip the active area to any size or aspect ratio, so a widescreen display is not a problem. There is even a button that will automatically clip the active area to the screen's aspect ratio. Another driver setting is the definition of hot cells, which are the buttons around the active area. A sheet with the hot cell definitions can be printed out and placed under the drawing area, providing quick identification of the hot cells' functions. These can be set to perform shortcuts, open a web site, or open a program. Finally, there is an area to test the pen's pressure sensitivity, as well as to change the minimum pressure required to click.The software that came with the tablet is also good, albeit somewhat useless. The most useful of these is Annotate All, which takes a screenshot of your current screen and lets you doodle all over it.In practical use, the tablet handles well. I use Corel's Photopaint and Draw (virtually equivalent to Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator), and have not had any problems. There is no cursor jumping, so long as the tip of the pen is within reasonable distance from the tablet (about an 1/2 inch). The batteries have been holding up well so far.Finally, I have to note that this tablet is as generic as it can possibly be. There are no brand markings anywhere, although UC-Logic's model number is on the back. I do not know if this would have an effect on any potential service issues.",True
24,"Circuit Breaker box was getting hard to decipher in the dark, the ink was just too faded to read in flashlight. Ordered this tape hoping it would work in my Dymo. It did. I made labels for each of the circuits, then drilled small holes in the case of the circuit breaker box and pop riveted them into place. I can read them easily now and no fear of faded ink. (I did glue over the holes and the rivets to seal the case against very small bugs. Probably not necessary, but easier that finding the box in the dark if it developed a ""bug."" I left the remains of the tape hanging from the box on a piece of string, in case we change or add to the circuits.",True
25,"The quality of the wood and screws is poor (some knots in the wood).Provides little advantage to just stepping up onto the chair (except no shoe print?). Not very stable as a step stool.Overall, disappointed.",False
26,"While the phone itself does what it is supposed to -- and it is also rather cost effective -- its absolute disregard for ""plays well with others"" makes it an automatic box & return ship. Not only does the device completely jam the wireless Wi-Fi and the wireless Sonos system in our home when it is on a call, but it is meant to be a wireless bully by design.The manufacturers instructions for wireless interference are to simply switch channels on every other wireless-enabled device in your home, rather than the other way around (which turned out to be a completely fruitless exercise). And although the handset does offer a wireless channel-switching button, its design has no intention to do so for the working order of other devices -- it's purely intended to switch frequencies for ""offensive"" purposes to get a clearer signal, any other device be damned.So as a phone, you can't knock that it works. But don't dare try to run anything else on 2.4GHz nearby. Ironically, its best application seems to be for causing mischief and jamming the wireless signals of annoying neighbors.UPDATE 1/30/2009: My wife had to toss this device today and buy a replacement, as the frustration of having me knock on her office door every time she used the phone (and thus kicked me off our wireless network) was too frustrating to handle. This I'd like to revise and give this product one star, since it makes life unbearable should you use anything else in your house on the 802.11 standard.",False
27,After having several Panasonic phones and having been pleased with all I purchased the KX-TGA270S as part of an expandable phone system. The listed features are great however the battery life is pathetic (on average less than 15 min. on a full charge). If you don't put the phone back on the charging base after each call you will be lucky to complete two calls before getting the low battery warning. In addition the displays intermittently go blank. I have four phone in my system and all four do the same thing. I have spoken to at least 8 other people with these phones and all have the same problem. Panasonic says there is nothing wrong with the design. With 35 years in the electronics industry I can assure you there is a design defect that Panasonic does not want to admit. I would not recommend that you purchase this phone.,False
28,"this wrist guard is OK, but it's NOT as pictured and it's a bit too small and not that great. annoying.",False
29,"Phone seems nice, but I haven't gone to the trouble (as others have pointed out) of adding phonebook entries, because we're probably going to return the phones. A fully-charged phone gets the low-batter warning after only a few hours off of the cradle, and will die completely overnight.Since we often leave our phones off the hook during the day, and we have kids that sometimes misplace them, a decent battery life is necessary...",False
30,"This is an awful design. Tape loosens almost immediately,the used portion does not get pulled up well enough leaving a loop hanging in the front, tape comes off the ""track"" and NO WAY TO TIGHTEN! After one use, product is rendered useless. I cannot believe that the tension is not adjustable. Tried to take unit apart and wind that way, after 10 minutes of wasted effort and prolific cursing I just had to throw it away. Oh, and the white correction medium, does not stick to the freakin' paper! Which is its only purpose. This is just bad, bad, bad.",False
31,"I must say, I'm very frustrated with this item, to the point that I, too, am writing this review when I'm not accustomed to doing so on Amazon.com. I bought this to use with my newly purchased EPSON Stylus Photo R300 printer. This is the first printer that I bought that supports borderless printing. Excitedly, I printed out a greeting card that I had prepared yesterday to sends off to friends and relatives; much to my dismay, there was a white strip on one edge of the printout.Determined that there was something wrong with the printer driver and/or my system (MacOSX 10.4.2 Tiger), I went on a rampant search for a fix. I tried unistalling and reinstalling the driver; tried different versions of the driver (one that came with Tiger, one that I downloaded from the Epson website, one that came with the printer); tried repairing permissions; I was this close to doing a fresh reinstall of the OS . . . at which point I had the sense to measure the paper. Lo-and-behold, the paper is NOT 4""x6"" but 4""x6.5"". Which explains the 0.5"" white band on one edge of the printout.Unfortunately, my printer doesn't support this paper size, which means in order to get a true borderless printout, I need to manually trim off the 0.5in with an exacto knife -- which is exactly what I could have done without buying new printer.Kodak, listen to your customers; labeling this as a 4""x6"" photo paper is deceiving. Making a 4*6.5 paper when many printers don't support that size is just senseless.Potential customer: do not buy this if borderless photo printing is what you want to do.",False
32,"This is the worst telephone clock radio ever designed. The radio function has dreadful sound and does not stick to the station. It finally went dead after a year, taking with it the whole alarm system, and making it useless. The phone function is very difficult to use in the dark. The keypad is not lit and it is easy to misdial. When the equipment was removed from the box it stank of chemicals for several days, and a notice said that it would take awhile for the smell to stop. Never bought a product before that had that problem. I agree with all the other negative comments in the other reviews except for the LED clock function. There is a switch that allows it to be bold or dim and the bold provides adequate lighting to see the time. However, don't buy this awful product.",False
33,"I loved the features for this phone, I mean how fun ringtones, faceplates, flashing antena's. Its a cell phone lovers dream. But unfortuantely like a cell phone it isn't a clear call maker. It makes a popping , yes I read the reviews before purchasing and I thought it was just their faulty phone, I was wrong. Were not just talking one popping noise it happens through the whole time you are on the phone about every 10-15 sec. It sounds like someone keeps pressing flash and swithching lines. It got so frustrating that I finally gave up my cool features and went for a phone that just worked. I guess we will have to wait for them to work out the quirks and try again in a year.",False
34,"After selecting a CAT5e cable these cable clips were suggested as ""Frequently bought together"". On that recommendation these were ordered. But when they arrived it was obvious that the clip was far to large to securely hold the cable that it was matched with on the website. You could easily fit 4 cables into each clip. More suitable for large co-ax cable.",False
35,"I was extremely dissapointed with this phone, especially since Panasonic have (or had, as my opinion now stands) such a great reputation when it comes to cordless phones. I exchanged my first phone for a replacement and still had the same problem: extremely low outgoing voice volume. People I spoke too had a lot of trouble hearing me speak, almost like I was holding the phone at a distance or cupping my hand over my mouth. While everything else about the phone seemed okay (nothing you wouldn't expect from a basic phone/ answering system), this one problem meant the phone was virtually useless.",False
36,"Only thing better about this phone is its unique looks. Bad things are many...- You cannot dial caller ID directly by pressing Talk button. And there is no way you can use this phone to give you options to dial (like adding 1 in the beginning of the 10 digit number, or truncating 10 digits to 7 (certain area codes allow 7 digit dialing, like in Chicago). My previous motorola phone used to give me these options.- All the more, you can save the caller ID but there is no way for you to move the cursor to the beginning of the number to add ""1"". Only way for you is to memorize (or write down) the number and reenter it after deleting the caller ID entry.- The buttons do not respond some times, require 2-3 presses, especially when you are pressing numbers for selceting options. Never faced this problem with any of my previous phones.- Speaker is OK...and there is no volume control...one would expect to have it on a phone set worth $150...isn't it.",False

39,"This phone is tempting. It looks great, feels nice on your ear, lacks an antenna, and has an inconspicuous base that doesn't draw attention. However, the phone is a poor performer compared to the excellent panasonic multi-handset KX-TG27X0 series. First, the panasonic can support 8 handsets and allow 4 handsets and the base speakerphone on the line simultaneously. The Siemens base supports just 4 handsets, and only 2 on the line simultaneously. The siemens handsets can subscribe to multiple bases, but will not switch from one base to the other as you move around. So if you move from one base's area to the other-whether you're on the line or not-your reception will fade and your call will be dropped. The siemens has terrible range. It wouldn't even cover my whole NYC apartment. The panasonic works all over my apartment, in the elevator, and 8 floors down in the lobby. That's impressive. The siemens' keypad is cramped, has stiff buttons, and has poor tactile feel. Not to mention an awful delay in the response to a button push. The Panasonic has a backlit key pad and buttons that are much more responsive and well spaced. And no delay on button pushing. The panasonic has &quot;booster&quot; function to increase the transmitting power and improve range and reception. Nothing but poor range and bad signal quality on the siemens. The panasonic does use menus, but the most used features during a call-speaker volume, flash, mute, signal booster-are all accessible with one button push. The siemens has no features immediately accessible.The siemens does not have a mute, requires you to hold down the recessesed &quot;mem&quot; key to &quot;flash&quot; or use call waiting,The siemens does have a few perks. The sound quality is nice and you get to name handsets. It does call recording and voice dialing, but it's not easy. It uses AA batteries so they're easilly and cheaply replaceable. It does allow you to lower the ringer volume at night. It does allow the caller to directly access one particular handset. But those are the icing on a cake. And the panasonic's cake is much better. And cheaper too.",False

42,"It took two shipments to finally get a shredder that made it in one piece. The shredder device itself is heavy duty, super quiet and does an excellent job. But the down side is the shredder part is so heavy it is easily knocked over because the waste basket is made from cheap plastic and weighs only 6-1/2 lbs. While the shredder weighs about 20 lbs. The first shredder was poorly packed and the basket was in pieces from the shredder banging around in the box and breaking the basket into little pieces. I suggest keeping the casters of an that should help steady the shredder on the basket. If it weren't for the stupid safety switches I'd put this shredder on a better built basket.",False
